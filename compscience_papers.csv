Abstract. The amount and availability of high-quality geo-spatial image 
data, such as digital satellite and aerial photographs, is increasing
dramatically. Task-based management of such visual information and
associated knowledge is a central concern for organisations that rely on
digital imagery. We are developing geo-spatial knowledge management
techniques that employ case-based reasoning as the core methodology. In
order to provide effective retrieval of task-based experiences that center
around geo-spatial imagery, we need to forward novel similarity metrics
for directly comparing the image components of experience cases. Based
on work in geo-spatial image database retrieval, we are building an effective 
similarity metric for geo-spatial imagery that makes comparisons
based on derived image features, their shapes, and the spatial relations
between them. This paper gives an overview of the geo-spatial knowledge
management context, describes our image similarity metric, and provides
an initial evaluation of the work.

"An Initial Experiment into Stereochemistry-Based Drug Design Using Inductive Logic Programming

Abstract. Previous applications of Inductive Logic Programming to
drug design have not addressed stereochemistry, or the three-dimensional
aspects of molecules. While some success is possible without 
consideration of stereochemistry, researchers within the pharmaceutical industry
consider stereochemistry to be central to most drug design problems.
This paper reports on an experimental application of the ILP system
P-Progol to stereochemistry-based drug design. The experiment tests
whether P-Progol can identify the structure responsible for the 
activity of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors from 28 positive
examples, that is, from 28 molecules that display the activity of ACE
inhibition. ACE inhibitors are a widely-used form of medication for the
treatment of hypertension. It should be stressed that this structure was
already known prior to the experiment and therefore is not a new 
discovery; the experiment was proposed by a researcher within the 
pharmaceutical industry to test the applicability of ILP to stereochemistry-based
drug design. While the result of the experiment is quite positive, one
challenge remains before ILP can be applied to a multitude of drug design problems.

Abstract. We introduce an application combining CBR and collaborative 
filtering techniques in the music domain. We describe a scenario
in which a new kind of recommendation is required, which is capable
of summarizing many recommendations in one suggestion. Our claim is
that recommending one set of goods is different from recommending a
single good many times. The paper illustrates how a case-based reasoning 
approach can provide an effective solution to this problem reducing
the drawbacks related to the user profiles. CoCoA, a compilation compiler 
advisor, will be described as a running example of a collaborative
case-based recommendation system.

Abstract

Although CBR has been advertised as a technique to elude knowledge engineering (RE), 
we argue that knowledge-level modeling in KE is of eminent importance 
to the success of CBR systems, both for practical and theoretical reasons.
Cases are knowledge structures linked to some underlying database (although
not necessarily in a one-to-one fashion), and in order to define case structures
and their relations to the database, domain knowledge is needed. In this paper,
we focus on KE for CBR in the domain of architectural design, first looking at
general analyses of work processes and information use, then discussing micro-analyses 
of task structure in order to define case size, finally proceeding to
knowledge-level evaluation of the domain knowledge acquired and modeled so
far.

Abstract
In this paper, we take a detailed look at the performance of components of an idealized
question answering system on two different tasks: the TREC Question Answering task
and a set of reading comprehension exams. We carry out three types of analysis: inherent
properties of the data, feature analysis, and performance bounds. Based on these analyses
we explain some of the performance results of the current generation of Q/A systems
and make predictions on future work. In particular, we present four findings: (1) Q/A
system performance is correlated with answer repetition, (2) relative overlap scores are
more effective than absolute overlap scores, (3) equivalence classes on scoring functions
can be used to quantify performance bounds, and (4) perfect answer typing still leaves a
great deal of ambiguity for a Q/A system because sentences often contain several items
of the same type.

Many sonification techniques use acoustic attributes such as frequency, intensity, and timbre to represent different
characteristics of multidimensional data.  Here we demonstrate a perceptual interaction between changes in pitch and
loudness, as well as perceived asymmetries in directional change.  Three experiments show that changes in loudness can
influence judgments of pitch change, changes in pitch can influence loudness change, and that increases in loudness are
judged to change more than equivalent decreases.  Within a sonification of stock market data, these characteristics created
perceptual distortions in the data set.  The results imply that in situations where precision is critical, caution should be
exercised when using lower level acoustic dimensions such as frequency and intensity to represent multidimensional data.

Abstract. A framework for combining Genetic Algorithms with LLP
methods is introduced and a novel binary representation and relevant
genetic operators are discussed. It is shown that the proposed representation 
encodes a subsumption lattice in a complete and compact way. It
is also shown that the proposed genetic operators are meaningful and can
be interpreted in ILP terms such as lgg(least general generalization) and
mgi (most general instance) . These operators can be used to explore a
subsumption lattice efficiently by doing binary operations (e.g. and/or).
An implementation of the proposed framework is used to combine Inverse
Entailment of CProgol with a genetic search.

ABSTRACT                                                                               
Our goal is to apply and evaluate soniÞcation for oil and gas exploration on a Responsive Workbench. The end-users are geological
interpreters who build up models of underground formations, and stake holders in a consortium of oil and gas companies, 
software vendors, and Virtual Environments researchers. Based on the goals and users we formulated development
criteria that the soniÞcation should be easy to explain, quick to understand, useful and usable. The development is based on a
scenario of interpreting a reservoir from multi-attribute well logs. The scenario helped us identify a Geiger-counter metaphor
that is congruent with the domain and familiar to most users. The psychoacoustic design of the Virtual Geiger allows several
logs to be heard together so that listeners may answer higher level questions about relations between logs. The Virtual Geiger
has been demonstrated to hundreds of people at oil and gas summits and review meetings. Many who tried it have made suggestions
for further sonifications. The consortium voted to continue work on sonification in the second round of the project.
The work described here is supported by a demonstration video.

Abstract. A learning algorithm for the class of range restricted Horn
expressions is presented and proved correct. The algorithm works within
the framework of learning from entailment, where the goal is to exactly
identify some pre-fixed and unknown expression by making questions to
membership and equivalence oracles. This class has been shown to be
learnable in previous work. The main contribution of this paper is in
presenting a more direct algorithm for the problem which yields an improvement 
in terms of the number of queries made to the oracles. The
algorithm is also adapted to the class of Horn expressions with inequalities 
on all syntactically distinct terms where a significant improvement
in the number of queries is obtained.

"Integrity Constraints in ILP Using a Monte Carlo Approach

Alípio Jorge, Pavel B. Brazdil

Abstract. Many state-of-the-art ILP systems require large numbers of
negative examples to avoid overgeneralization. This is a considerable
disadvantage for many ILP applications, namely inductive program synthesis 
where relativelly small and sparse example sets are a more realistic
scenario. Integrity constraints are first order clauses that can play the role
of negative examples in an inductive process. One integrity constraint
can replace a long list of ground negative examples. However, checking
the consistency of a program with a set of integrity constraints usually 
involves heavy theorem-proving. We propose an efficient constraint
satisfaction algorithm that applies to a wide variety of useful integrity
constraints and uses a Monte Carlo strategy. It looks for inconsistencies
by random generation of queries to the program. This method allows
the use of integrity constraints instead of (or together with) negative
examples. As a consequence programs to induce can be specified more
rapidly by the user and the ILP system tends to obtain more accurate
definitions. Average running times are not greatly affected by the use of
integrity constraints compared to ground negative examples.

"INFORMATION EXTRACTION AS A BASIS FOR PORTABLE TEXT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS

ELLEN M. RILOFF
University of Massachusetts Amherst
Department of Computer Science
ABSTRACT
Knowledge­based natural language processing systems have achieved good success with many
tasks, but they often require many person­months of effort to build an appropriate knowledge
base. As a result, they are not portable across domains. This knowledge­engineering bottleneck
must be addressed before knowledge­based systems will be practical for real­world applications.
This dissertation addresses the knowledge­engineering bottleneck for a natural language processing
task called ``information extraction''. A system called AutoSlog is presented which automatically
constructs dictionaries for information extraction, given an appropriate training corpus. In the
domain of terrorism, AutoSlog created a dictionary using a training corpus and five person­hours
of effort that achieved 98% of the performance of a hand­crafted dictionary that took approximately
1500 person­hours to build.
This dissertation also describes three algorithms that use information extraction to support
high­precision text classification. As more information becomes available on­line, intelligent
information retrieval will be crucial in order to navigate the information highway efficiently
and effectively. The approach presented here represents a compromise between keyword­based
techniques and in­depth natural language processing. The text classification algorithms classify
texts with high accuracy by using an underlying information extraction system to represent
linguistic phrases and contexts. Experiments in the terrorism domain suggest that increasing the
amount of linguistic context can improve performance. Both AutoSlog and the text classification
algorithms are evaluated in three domains: terrorism, joint ventures, and microelectronics. An
important aspect of this dissertation is that AutoSlog and the text classification systems can be
easily ported across domains.

Abstract. The success of a case-based reasoning system depends critically on
the performance of the retrieval algorithm used and, specifically, on its
efficiency, competence, and quality characteristics. In this paper we describe a
novel retrieval technique that is guided by a model of case competence and that,
as a result, benefits from superior efficiency, competence and quality features.

Abstract
Singular value decomposition (SVD) can be viewed as a method for
unsupervised training of a network that associates two classes of events
reciprocally by linear connections through a single hidden layer. SVD
was used to learn and represent relations among very large numbers of
words (20k­60k) and very large numbers of natural text passages (1k­
70k) in which they occurred. The result was 100­350 dimensional
""semantic spaces"" in which any trained or newly added word or passage
could be represented as a vector, and similarities were measured by the
cosine of the contained angle between vectors. Good accuracy in
simulating human judgments and behaviors has been demonstrated by
performance on multiple­choice vocabulary and domain knowledge
tests, emulation of expert essay evaluations, and in several other ways.
Examples are also given of how the kind of knowledge extracted by this
method can be applied.

Abstract
This paper discusses several distributed power­
aware routing protocols in wireless ad­hoc networks
(especially sensor networks). We seek to optimize the
lifetime of the network. We have developed three dis­tributed 
power­aware algorithms and analyzed their ef­ficiency 
in terms of the number of message broadcasts
and the overall network lifetime modeled as the time
to the first message that can not be sent. These are:
(1) a distributed min Power algorithm (modeled on a
distributed version of Dijkstra's algorithm), (2) a dis­tributed 
max­min algorithm, and (3) the distributed ver­sion of 
our the centralized online max­min zPmin al­gorithm 
presented in [12]. The first two algorithms are
used to define the third, although they are very inter­esting 
and useful on their own for applications where
the optimization criterion is the minimum power, re­spectively 
the maximum residual power. The distributed
max­min zPmin algorithm optimizes the overall life­-time 
of the network by avoiding nodes of low power,
while not using too much total power.

Abstract. Inverse entailment (IE) is known as a technique for finding
inductive hypotheses in Horn theories. When a background theory is
nonmonotonic, however, LB is not applicable in its present form. The
purpose of this paper is extending the JE technique to nonmonotonic
inductive logic programming (ILP). To this end, we first establish a new
entailment theorem in normal logic programs, then introduce the notion
of contrapositive programs. Finally, a theory of IE in nonmonotonic JLP
is constructed.

"Handling Vague and Qualitative Criteria in Case-Based Reasoning Applications

Abstract. In some case-based reasoning (CBR) applications for decision 
support there are a number of vague or qualitative criteria that have
to be taken into account by the similarity measure. Sometimes, these criteria 
are very hard to acquire or quantify and they often conflict with the
main quality criterion that is measured by the similarity function. Surprisingly, 
this sometimes is true even for cost criteria (mostly believed to
be quite quantitative): in certain applications, the acceptable cost limit
depends mostly on the quality that is available and thus cannot be specified 
a priori. This paper discusses the problems arising from this kind
of implicit criteria and shows approaches of how they can be integrated
into the similarity measure of a case-based reasoning system without the
need of artificially quantifying them.

SUMMARY                                                          
Until recently, sound has been given little attention in computer graphics and related domains              
of computer animation and virtual environments, although sounds which are properly synchronized to                   
motion provide a great deal of information about events in the environment. Sounds are often not                     
properly synchronized because the sounds and the phenomena that caused the sounds are not                            
considered in an integrated way. In this paper, we present an integrated approach to motion and                      
sound as it applies to computer animation and virtual environments. The key to this approach is                      
synchronization by mapping the motion parameters to sound parameters so that the sound changes as                    
a result of changes in the motion. This is done by representing sounds using a technique for functional              
composition analogous to the ""shade trees"" which we call timbre trees. These timbre trees are used as a              
part of a sound description language that is analogous to scene description languages like RenderMan.                
Using this methodology, we have produced convincing sound effects for a wide variety of animated                     
scenes including the automatic generation of background music.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe case-based techniques in a medical application. We
have developed a prototype of an antibiotics therapy adviser within the ICONS
project, where the main advantage of applying CBR techniques is to speed-up
the process of computing advisable therapies. However, some adaptations do
not really belong to the Case-Based Reasoning paradigm though information
from former cases is considered. They deal with rather typical medical tasks,
namely modifications due to information updates. In our incrementally working
system we have attempted to solve the problem of the continuously increasing
number of stored cases by generalising from specific single eases to more
general prototypes and by subsequently erasing redundant cases. Here we present
results of experiments with threshold settings for our prototype architecture.
The results show that the chosen design, which has mainly been founded on
experiences with diagnostic applications, is not only advantageous for this
therapeutic task, but that it contains a slight drawback as well.

ABSTRACT                                                                                                           
The inherent visual nature of Internet browsers makes the Web inaccessible to the visually impaired. Although several non-visual 
browsers have been developed, they usually transform the visual content of HTML documents into textual information
only, that can be rendered by a text-to-speech converter or a Braille device. The loss of spatial layout and of textual attributes
should be avoided since they often bear visually important information. Moreover, typical non-visual Internet browsers do
not allow visually impaired and sighted individuals to easily work together using the same environment. This paper presents
WebSound, a new generic Web sonification tool and its application to a 3D audio augmented Internet browser (Internet
Explorer 5.0) developed by the Computer Vision Group at the University of Geneva.

ABSTRACT
Recent work has demonstrated that the assessment of pair­
wise object similarity can be approached in an axiomatic
manner using information theory. We extend this concept
specifically to document similarity and test the effective­
ness of an information­theoretic measure for pairwise docu­
ment similarity. We adapt query retrieval to rate the quality
of document similarity measures and demonstrate that our
proposed information­theoretic measure for document simi­larity 
yields statistically significant improvements over other
popular measures of similarity.

Abstract. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is suited to problem solving in
domains where there are recurring problems. This paper describes the
development of a CBR system for use in such a domain, the Technical
Support department of an aircraft manufacturing company. The system uses
three types of indexing: knowledge-guided induction, inductive indexing
and nearest neighbour matching. The resultant system integrates case based
retrieval with a relational database system to provide a rich environment to
help manage the life cycle of a technical support query. In early tests with
the system, staff can discern if a new query is a recurring problem and has
been solved before or if it is a completely new unsolved technical query.

forms and media, the conceptual and technical considerations required to mount an electronic multimedia opera
add significant layers of complexity.  Design issues including projecting visual media, the implementing of an
immersive audio environment and maintaining synchronization (between live singers and digital music, 3D
computer animation, stage lighting and projected imagery) add to the standard list of compositional and
production challenges. An overview of the design and implementation of such a production, StarChild: The
Opera, offers a primer in the musical and extra-musical considerations that are required to realize a large-scale
composition in an electronic mixed media environment.

Abstract                                                          
Eficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties 
is an important topic with many applications in science and    
engineering. Examples include environmental pollution border line       
identification, identification of the limits of anoil basin, or discrimination
between contaminated and healthy tissue in medicine. This       
paper presents an approach for such visualization using points as      
display primitives. Our approach is to render each polygon as a collection
of points and to displace each point from the surface in the     
direction of the surface normal by an amount proportional to some       
random number multiplied by the uncertainty level at that point.      
This approach can be used in combination with other techniques      
such as pseudo-coloring and shading to give rise to eficient and    
revealing visualizations. The method is used to visualize real and  
simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries.

In this paper we study the query complexity of finding local minimum points
of a boolean function. This task occurs frequently in exact learning algorithms
for many natural classes, such as monotone DNF, O(log n)­term DNF, unate DNF,
and decision trees. On the negative side, we prove that any (possibly randomized)
algorithm that produces a local minimum of a function f chosen from a sufficiently
``rich'' concept class, using a membership oracle for f , must
ask
 n 2 ) membership
queries in the worst case. In particular, this lower bound applies to the class of
decision trees. A simple algorithm is known that achieves this lower bound. On the
positive side, we show that for the class O(log n)­term DNF finding local minimum
points requires only (n log n) membership queries (and more generally (tn)
membership queries for t­term DNF with t  n). This efficient procedure improves
the time and query complexity of known learning algorithms for the class O(log n)­
term DNF.

Abstract
Many tools for debugging parallel programs offer valuable
informati onto programmers but workin only a limited 
range of situations. For example, they may help a                                                     
programmer detect a specific class of program errors, or                                                       
they may work on just one parallel machine. A broadly                                                     
useful debugger should offer several views of a program's                                                      
behavior, and it should work equally well on many paallel 
architectures. Furthermore, the user should be able                                                   
to design and install new program views that match the                                                     
structure of a particular program. In this paper we describe 
Panorama, a parallel debugger that should offer
these benefits. Panorama offers the programmer multiple                                                        
views of the program's behavior, andit includes a simple
logging and replay facility that allows parallel programs                                                  
be debugged either on-line or ost-mortem.

"Using Learned Extraction Patterns for Text Classification

Abstract. A major knowledge­engineering bottleneck for information
extraction systems is the process of constructing an appropriate dictio­nary 
of extraction patterns. AutoSlog is a dictionary construction system
that has been shown to substantially reduce the time required for knowl­edge 
engineering by learning extraction patterns automatically. However,
an open question was whether these extraction patterns were useful for
tasks other than information extraction. We describe a series of experi­ments 
that show how the extraction patterns learned by AutoSlog can be
used for text classification. Three dictionaries produced by AutoSlog for
different domains performed well in our text classification experiments.

Abstract. Recommender systems combine user profiling and filtering
techniques to provide more pro-active and personal information retrieval
systems, and have been gaining in popularity as a way of overcoming the
ubiquitous information overload problem. Many recommender systems
operate as interactive systems that seek feedback from the end-user as
part of the recommendation process to revise the users query. In this
paper we examine different forms of feedback that have been used in the
past and focus on a low-cost preference-based feedback model, which to
date has been very much under utilised. In particular we describe and
evaluate a novel comparison-based recommendation framework which is
designed to utilise preference-based feedback. Specifically, we present results 
that highlight the benefits of a number of new query revision strategies 
and evidence to suggest that the popular more-like-this strategy may
be flawed.

Abstract. In our previous work we introduced a hybrid, GA&ILP-based 
approach for learning of stem-suffix segmentation rules from an
unmarked list of words. Evaluation of the method was made difficult by
the lack of word corpora annotated with their morphological segmentation. 
Here the hybrid approach is evaluated indirectly, on the task of
tag prediction. A pair of stem-tag and suffix-tag lexicons is obtained by
the application of that approach to an annotated lexicon of word-tag
pairs. The two lexicons are then used to predict the tags of unseen words
in two ways, (1) by using only the stem and suffix generated by the
segmentation rules, and (2) for all matching combinations of stem and
suffix present in the lexicons. The results show high correlation between
the constituents generated by the segmentation rules, and the tags of
the words in which they appear, thereby demonstrating the linguistic
relevance of the segmentations produced by the hybrid approach.

Abstract. Data Mining and knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)
promise to play an important role in the way people interact with databases,
especially decision support databases where analysis and exploration operations 
are essential. Inductive logic programming can potentially play
some key roles in KDD. This is an extended abstract for an invited talk
in the conference. In the talk, we define the basic notions in data mining
and KDD, define the goals, present motivation, and give a high-level definition 
of the KDD Process and how it relates to Data Mining. We then
focus on data mining methods. Basic coverage of a sampling of methods
will be provided to illustrate the methods and how they are used. We
cover a case study of a successful application in science data analysis: the
classification of cataloging of a major astronomy sky survey covering 2
billion objects in the northern sky. The system can outperform human as
well as classical computational analysis tools in astronomy on the task of
recognizing faint stars and galaxies. We also cover the problem of scaling
a clustering problem to a large catalog database of billions of objects. We
conclude with a listing of research challenges and we outline area where
ILP could play some important roles in KDD.

Abstract: ­ The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a transformation that can be used to analyze the
temporal and spectral properties of non­stationary signals like audio. In this paper we describe some
applications of the DWT to the problem of extracting information from non­speech audio. More specifically
automatic classification of various types of audio using the DWT is described and compared with other
traditional feature extractors proposed in the literature. In addition, a technique for detecting the beat attributes
of music is presented. Both synthetic and real world stimuli were used to evaluate the performance of the beat
detection algorithm.

Abstract
Motivated by results in information­theory, we de­scribe 
a modification of the popular boosting algo­rithm 
AdaBoost and assess its performance both
theoretically and empirically. We provide theo­retical
and empirical evidence that the proposed
boosting scheme will have lower training and test­ing 
error than the original (non­ confidence­rated)
version of AdaBoost. Our modified boosting al­gorithm 
and its analysis also suggests an explana­
tion for why boosting with confidence­rated pre­dictions 
often markedly outperforms boosting with­
out confidence­rated predictions. Finally, our mo­tivations 
and analyses provide further impetus for
the study of boosting in an information­theoretic,
as opposed to decision­theoretic, light.

Abstract. Problem solving in weak theory domains should compensate for
the lack of strong theories by combining the various other knowledge types
involved. Such methods should be able to effectively combine general
domain knowledge with specific case knowledge. A method is described that
utilises a presumably extensive and dense model of general domain
knowledge as explanatory support for case-based problem solving and
learning. A generic reasoning method - captured in what is called the
ACTIVATE-EXPLAIN-FOCUS cycle - is able to utilise a rich knowledge model in
producing context-dependent explanations. A specialisation of this method
for each of the main subprocesses of case-based reasoning is presented, and
illustrated with examples.

Abstract                                        
An interdisciplinary project encompassing sound synthesis, music composition, sonification, and
visualization of music is facilitated by the high-performance computing capabilities and the virtual-reality
environments available at Argonne National Laboratory.  The paper describes the main features of the
project's centerpiece, DIASS (Digital Instrument for Additive Sound Synthesis); ""A.N.L.-folds"", an
equivalence class of compositions produced with DIASS; and aplication of DIASS in two experiments in
the sonification of complex scientific data.  Some of the larger issues connected with this project, such as
the changing ways in which both scientists and composers perform their tasks, are briefly discussed.

Abstract. Cohens [1] refinement rules provide a flexible mechanism
for introducing intentional background knowledge in an ILP system.
Whereas Cohen used a limited second order theorem prover to implement 
the rule interpreter, we extend the method to use a full Prolog
interpreter. This makes the introduction of more complex background
knowledge possible. Although refinement rules have been used to generate 
literals for a general-to-specific search, we show how they can also be
used as filters to reduce the number of literals in an RLGG algorithm.
Each literal constructed by the LGG is tested against the refinement
rules and only admitted if a refinement rule has been satisfied.

Abstract. We investigate the use of a connectionist model of a mirror
neuron cortical network for a context free syntax acquisition task. A finite
state representation of the context free grammar is learned by an implicit
knowledge system (IKS) modelled by a connectionist network. A mirror
neuron system (MNS) whose evolutionary pedigree suggests adaptation
for goal-directed sequential processing is used to track embedded recursions 
in a learned finite state model of the grammar. The mirror system
modifies the output of the IKS depending on the depth of embedding.
Reciprocally the IKS updates the MNS as natural `goals' occur within
a sequence during sentence production. This solves the computationally
hard problem of inferring contexts from sequential input.

ABSTRACT
A method is proposed for parametric motion estimation
of an image region. It is assumed that the region consid­ered 
undergoes an affine transformation, which means
that the motion is composed of a translation and a pure
affine function of pixel coordinates. The solution of the
object correspondence problem is assumed to be known.
The estimation of the six motion parameters is based on
the moments of the corresponding image regions. Mo­ments 
up to order three are needed. For the motion
computation each region is transformed to a standard
position which is defined using affine invariants. The
result of motion estimation is checked in the construc­tion 
of a mosaic image.

Abstract
Information extraction (IE) systems are costly to
build because they require development texts, pars­ing 
tools, and specialized dictionaries for each ap­plication 
domain and each natural language that
needs to be processed. We present a novel
method for rapidly creating IE systems for new lan­guages
 by exploiting existing IE systems via cross­
language projection. Given an IE system for a
source language (e.g., English), we can transfer its
annotations to corresponding texts in a target lan­guage 
(e.g., French) and learn information extrac­
tion rules for the new language automatically. In
this paper, we explore several ways of realizing both
the transfer and learning processes using off­-the-shelf 
machine translation systems, induced word
alignment, attribute projection, and transformation­
based learning. We present a variety of experiments
that show how an English IE system for a plane
crash domain can be leveraged to automatically cre­ate 
 French IE system for the same domain.

ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results from a qualitative case study 
of an auditory version of the game Towers of Hanoi. The goal  
of this study was to explore qualitative aspects of auditory  
direct manipulation and the subjective experience from playing 
the game. The results show that it is important to provide
a way of focusing in the auditory space. Articulatory directness 
was also an important issue and feedback should support 
the movement of the objects in the auditory space.

Abstract 
Program activity graphs (PAGs) can be constructed from timestamped traces
of appropriate execution events.   Information about the activities on the k longest execution
paths is useful in the analysis of parallel program performance.  In this paper, four algorithms
for finding the near-critical paths of PAGs ar e compared, including a best-first search (BFS)
algorithm that is worst-case asymptotically optimal in terms of both time and space.  Results
confirming the practical efficiency of the BFS algorithm are presented for five application
programs.  A framework for using the near-critical path information is also described.  The
framework includes statistical summaries and visualization capabilities that build upon the
foundation of existing performance analysis tools.  Within the framework, guidance is
provided by the Maximum Benefit Metric, which uses near-critical path data to predict the
maximum overall performance improvement that may be realized by optimizing particular
critical path activities.  The framework is validated by a case study:  development and tuning
of a parallel near-critical path algorithm.  Examples are cited illustrating the utility of both
framework components.

Abstract
The increasing availability of online databases and
other information resources in digital libraries has
created the need for efficient and effective algo­rithms 
for selecting databases to search. A number
of techniques have been proposed for query rout­ing 
or database selection. We have developed a
methodology and metrics that can be used to di­rectly 
compare competing techniques. They can
also be used to isolate factors that influence the
performance of these techniques so that we can better 
understand performance issues. In this paper
we describe the methodology we have used to ex­amine 
the performance of database selection algo­
rithms such as gGlOSS and CORI. In addition we
develop the theory behind a ``random'' database
selection algorithm and show how it can be used
to help analyze the behavior of realistic database
selection algorithms.

Abstract
The majority of work in music information retrieval (IR) has been focused on
symbolic representations of music. However, most of the digitally available
music is in the form of raw audio signals. Although various attempts at
monophonic and polyphonic transcription have been made, none has been
successful and general enough to work with real world signals.
In this paper we describe some initial e#orts at building IR tools for
real world audio signals. Our approach is based on signal processing, sta­tistical 
pattern recognition and visualization techniques. We try to gather
as much information as possible without attempting to perform polyphonic
transcription.
A frequently ignored aspect in emerging fields like music IR is the im­portance 
of the user in building a successful system. We describe some new
graphical user interfaces that accommodate di#erent modes of interaction
with the user. More specifically we describe an augmented sound editor for
annotating, classifying and segmenting music and we define TimbreGrams
a new visual representation for audio files.

"An Interactive Beat Tracking and Visualisation System    

Simon Dixon    
Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna
email: simon@oef ai.at

Abstract
This paper describes Beat Root, a system which performs 
automatic beat tracking on audio or MIDI data and creates a            
graphical and audio representation of the data and results,         
as part of an interactive interface for correcting errors or    
selecting alternative metrical levels for beat tracking. The     
graphical interface displays the input data and the computed       
beat times, and allows the user to add, delete and adjust the         
beat times and then automatically re-track the remaining data      
based on the user input. The system also provides audio feedback
consisting of the original input data accompanied by a         
percussion instrument sounding at the computed beat times.        
At the heart of the system is abe attracking algorithm which         
estimate stempo based on the frequency of occurrence of the         
various time durations between pairs of note on set times, and       
then uses a multiple hypothesis search to nd the sequence         
of note on sets that best matches one of the possible tempos.         
The primary application of this system is in the analysis of        
tempo and timing in musical performance, although the beat         
tracking algorithm itself has been shown to perform at least        
as well as other state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract--- All known constructions of information theo­retic 
t­out­of­n secret sharing schemes require secure, private
communication channels among the parties for the reconstruction 
of the secret. In this work we investigate the cost
of performing the reconstruction over public communication
channels. A naive implementation of this task distributes
2n \Gamma 2 one times pads to each party. This results in shares
whose size is 2n \Gamma 1 times the secret size. We present three
implementations of such schemes that are substantially more
efficient:
ffl A scheme enabling multiple reconstructions of the se­cret 
by different subsets of parties, with factor O(n=t)
increase in the shares' size.
ffl A one­time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction of
the secret, with O(log(n=t)) increase in the shares' size.
ffl A one­time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction by
a set of size exactly t, with factor O(1) increase in the
shares' size.
We prove that the first implementation is optimal (up to
constant factors) by showing a tight \Omega\Gamma n=t) lower bound for
the increase in the shares' size.

Abstract. The existing image interpretation systems lack robustness and
accuracy. They cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions or to new
objects. The application of machine learning to image interpretation is the next
logical step. Our proposed approach aims at the development of dedicated
machine learning techniques at all levels of image interpretation in a systematic
fashion. In this paper we propose a system which uses Case-Based Reasoning
(CBR) to optimize image segmentation at the low level according to changing
image acquisition conditions and image quality. The intermediate-level unit
extracts the case representation used by the high-level unit for further
processing. At the high level, CBR is employed to dynamically adapt image
interpretation.

Abstract: Current Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) process models present CBR
as a low maintenance AI-technology and do not take the processes that have to
be enacted during system development and utilization into account. Since a
CBR system can only be useful if it is integrated into an organizational

acquisition, -utilization and -maintenance have to be put in place. In this paper
the short-comings of classical CBR process models are analyzed, and, based on
the experiences made during the development of the case-based help-desk
support system HOMER, the managerial, organizational and technical
processes related to the development and utilization of CBR systems described.

"The All-or-Nothing Nature of
Two-Party Secure Computation

Amos Beimel y Tal Malkin z Silvio Micali x
December 8, 1999

Abstract
A function f is computationally securely computable if two computationally-bounded
parties, Alice, having a secret input x, and Bob, having a secret input y, can talk back
and forth so that (even if one of them is malicious) (1) Bob learns essentially only
f(x; y) while (2) Alice learns essentially nothing.
We prove that, if any non-trivial function can be so computed, then so can every
function. Consequently, the complexity assumptions suÆcient and/or required for
computationally securely computing f are the same for every non-trivial function f .

Abstract
The paper presents a novel method for domain
specific sense assignment. The method
determines the domain specific relevance of
GermaNet synsets on the basis of the
relevance of their constituent terms that co­-occur 
within representative domain corpora.
The approach is task independent and
completely automatic. Experiments show
results on three selected domains: business,

Abstract
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user
to read information from a database without revealing to
the server storing the database which information he has
read. Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky [23] construct, based on the
quadratic residuosity assumption, a single­server PIR proto­col 
with small communication complexity. Cachin, Micali,
and Stadler [5] present a single­server PIR protocol with a
smaller communication complexity, based on the (new) \Phi­
hiding assumption.
A major question, addressed in the present work, is what
assumption is the minimal assumption necessary for the con­struction 
of single­server private information retrieval pro­tocols 
with small communication complexity. We prove that
if there is a (0­error) PIR protocol in which the server sends
less than n bits then one­way functions exist (where n is the
number of bits in the database). That is, even saving one bit
compared to the naive protocol, in which the entire database
is sent, already requires one­way functions. The same result
holds (but requires more work) even if we allow the retrieval
to fail with probability of at most 1=(8n). Moreover, similar
results hold even if we allow constant probability of error.
For example, we prove that if there is a PIR protocol with er­
ror 1=4 and communication complexity less than n=10 bits,
then one­way functions exist.

"Category-Based Filtering and User Stereotype Cases
to Reduce the Latency Problem in Recommender Systems

Mikael Sollenborn and Peter Funk

Abstract. Collaborative filtering is an often successful method for personalized
item selection in Recommender systems. However, in domains where items are
frequently added, collaborative filtering encounters the latency problem.
Characterized by the systems inability to select recently added items, the
latency problem appears because new items in a collaborative filtering system
must be reviewed before they can be recommended. Content-based filtering
may help to counteract this problem, but runs the risk of only recommending
items almost identical to the ones the user has appreciated before. In this paper,
a combination of category-based filtering and user stereotype cases is proposed
as a novel approach to reduce the latency problem. Category-based filtering
puts emphasis on categories as meta-data to enable quicker personalization.
User stereotype cases, identified by clustering similar users, are utilized to
decrease response times and improve the accuracy of recommendations when
user information is incomplete.

Abstract. This paper presents the object-based knowledge representation 
system ROCADE, that is aimed at the development of case-based
reasoning (CBR) systems. cBR is studied by reference to the two levels
defined by Newell: at the knowledge level, a general detailed model of
tbe CBR process has been proposed. This model is intended to be implemented 
at the symbol level materialized by the ROCADE system. This
paper presents these two complementary levels and focuses on ROCADE.
The concepts and reasoning mechanisms of ROCADE are described, as
well as its architecture. Then, its architecture allowing different ways to
use it is presented. ROCADE is illustrated with examples of two CBR systems. 
The implementation of 2 CBR systems are used to illustrate the
rocade system the functionalities of the rocade system

ABSTRACT                                                                                                                
The research presented here addresses how line          
graphs can be made accessible to blind and visually     
impaired people through the use of non-speech audio.    
Previous research has focused on the sonification of a  
single data series.  This paper describes a method of   
sonifying two data series, and the design of two        
modes (parallel mode and serial mode) for browsing      
the graphs. Quantitative evaluation showed that both    
browsing modes were successful, with the parallel       
mode being particularly effective.

Abstract.                                                    
The views of some artists on what constitutes life are explored, with the aim of
challenging those within the artificial life research community to rethink and
perhaps expand their own views about the term and its meaningful application. The
focus is on the musical works of  Steve Reich and the paintings of Wassily
Kandinsky. The role of the observer in determining when it is appropriate to label a
hing as living is also discussed.

"A Case-Based Methodology for Planning Individualized Case Oriented Tutoring

Alexander Seitz

seitz@ki.informatik.uni-ulm.de



Case oriented tutoring gives students the possibility to practice their acquired
theoretical knowledge in the context of concrete cases. Accordingly, tutoring
systems for individualized learning have to take the skills of students at
applying their knowledge to problem solving into account. This paper describes
a case-based methodology for planning tutoring processes depending on the
skills of individual users. We develop methods for retrieving tutoring plans of
users with similar skills and present adaptation techniques for improving these
plans based on the students behavior during the corresponding tutoring
process. The developed methodology is based on the notion that a student has to
perform threads of associations in the process of problem solving.

Abstract. In this paper, we present an approach integrating neurule-based and
case-based reasoning. Neurules are a kind of hybrid rules that combine a
symbolic (production rules) and a connectionist representation (adaline unit).
Each neurule is represented as an adaline unit. One way that the neurules can be
produced is from symbolic rules by merging the symbolic rules having the
same conclusion. In this way, the number of rules in the rule base is decreased.
If the symbolic rules, acting as source knowledge of the neurules, do not cover
the full complexities of the domain, accuracy of the produced neurules is
affected as well. To improve accuracy, neurules can be integrated with cases
representing their exceptions. The integration approach enhances a previous
method integrating symbolic rules with cases. The use of neurules instead of
symbolic rules improves the efficiency of the inference mechanism and allows
for drawing conclusions even if some of the inputs are unknown.

ABSTRACT
This paper presents Personal WebMelody, a sonified web                                                
server that informs its administrator of both normal and                                              
abnormal operation through background music. It allows                                                
customization and full integration of system-generated music                                          
representing web server activity with external music sources                                          
(audio CD, MP3, etc) selected by the administrator.                                                   
Our sonification technique works by associating MIDI or WAV                                           
sound tracks with web server events. In an attempt to enable                                          
the webmaster to listen to such system-generated music for a                                          
long period without becoming fatigued, we introduce the                                               
opportunity of mixing an external music source with system-                                           
generated music. In this way, the administrator cheanar  the                                          
status of the web server while listening to his or her preferred                                      
music.                                                                                                
We present an empirical study that shows how our web server                                           
sonification can convey useful information efficiently.

Abstract. We consider inductive logic programming guided by a language
bias called abstraction schemata which enables us to specify a partial structure 
for a target program. Specifically, to improve the efficiency of such learning, 
we discuss a class of programs for which it is possible to devise a learning 
algorithm capable of identifying and pruning unpromising uses of the
schemata. This identification process includes the bias shift problem: how to
decide whether a hypothesis space contains no correct program with respect
to a given example specification. For solving this problem, a required property 
of hypothesis spaces is discovered. This result yields a class of programs
that are beyond the representational capabilities of previous approaches --
most notably, non-trivial programs with local variables.

ABSTRACT
We investigate the performance of metasearch algorithms
in terms of how much they improve consistency. We find
that three di#erent metasearch algorithms, each over three
datasets, usually improve the consistency of search results;
sometimes the improvement is dramatic. Furthermore, con­sistency 
tends to improve when performance improves.

Abstract. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for the existence
of the moat specific hypothesis (MSH) in Progol. Muggleton [2] showed
that for any first order theory (background knowledge) B and a single
clause (a positive example) E, there exists the most specific hypothesis
-bot(B, E) which satisfies B A -bot(B, E) |= E and for any hypothesis
H satisfying B A H |= E, H entails bot(B, E) assuming that hypotheses
are all single clauses. Yamamoto[8] gave a counter example and indicated
that Muggletons proof contains error. He also gave a sufficient condition
under which the MSH exists. In this paper, we give another and more
realistic sufficient condition to guarantee the existence of the MSH.

"Spatial composition using cases : IDIOM

Abstract. This paper describes a system called IDIOM (Interactive Design 
using Intelligent Objects and Models) that was developed in order
to study model-based case combination and adaptation in design. Intelligent 
objects are defined to be parts of cases that are interpreted
at run-time by domain models and through user interaction. Incremental 
parameterization and dimensionality reduction ensures that design
solutions are proposed quickly and reliably. An implementation in the
domain of spatial composition for building designs demonstrates several
aspects of the approach.

Abstract. The definition of suitable case base maintenance policies is
widely recognized as a major success key of CBR systems; underestimating 
this issue may lead to systems that that do not perform adequately
under performance dimensions, namely computation time, competence
and quality of solutions. The goal of the present paper is to analyse an
automatic case base management strategy in the context of multi-modal
architectures combining CBR and Model-Based Reasoning. The strategy,
called Learning by Failure with Forgetting (LFF ) is based on incremental 
learning of cases interleaved with off-line processes of case deletion,
in order to control the content and the size of the case library. Results
from an extensive experimental analysis in an industrial plant diagnosis
domain is then reported, showing the usefulness of LFF with respect
to the maintenance of suitable performance level for the target system.

Abstract. In this paper we present a case-based approach to the recognition 
of digital images. The architecture we propose is based on the
wavelet transform that has been used for the representation, in the
form of old cases, of images already known to the system. The paper
also presents our report on a case study in the field of mobile robots .
The described system is capable of analyzing maps obtained from the
sensors of a robot, and classifing them as one of the possible objects
present in the environment in which the robot navigates. The first results 
we have obtained are encouraging and support the choice of the
case-based approach to image recognition using the wavelet transform as
a tool for image representation and analysis.

"A Corpus­Based Approach for Building Semantic Lexicons

Ellen Riloff and Jessica Shepherd

Abstract
Semantic knowledge can be a great asset to
natural language processing systems, but
it is usually hand­coded for each applica­tion. 
Although some semantic information
is available in general­purpose knowledge
bases such as WordNet and Cyc, many ap­plications 
require domain­specific lexicons
that represent words and categories for a
particular topic. In this paper, we present
a corpus­based method that can be used
to build semantic lexicons for specific categories. 
The input to the system is a small
set of seed words for a category and a rep­resentative 
text corpus. The output is a
ranked list of words that are associated
with the category. A user then reviews the
top­ranked words and decides which ones
should be entered in the semantic lexicon.
In experiments with five categories, users
typically found about 60 words per cate­gory 
in 10­15 minutes to build a core se­mantic lexicon.

Abstract. This paper presents the results of the comparison of the performance of a
hierarchical case representation using a context guided retrieval method against that of a
simpler flat file representation using standard nearest neighbour retrieval. The estimation of
the construction costs of light industrial warehouse buildings is used as the test domain.
Each case comprises approximately 400 features. These are structured into a hierarchical
case representation that holds more general contextual features at its top and specific
building elements at its leaves. A modified nearest neighbour retrieval algorithm is used
that is guided by contextual similarity. Problems are decomposed into sub-problems and
solutions recomposed into a final solution. The comparative results show that the context
guided retrieval method using the hierarchical case representation out performs the simple
flat file representation and standard nearest neighbour retrieval.

Abstract 
Can readability on small screens be improved by using Rapid Serial Visual 
Presentation (RSVP) that adapts the presentation speed to characteristics found in 
the text? In this thesis Adaptive RSVP is introduced together with two algorithms for 
adaptation. Findings from a usability evaluation, where the ability to read long and 
short texts on a mobile device in a realistic setting was assessed, are reported. In a 
balanced repeated-measurement experiment employing 16 subjects two variants of 
Adaptive RSVP were benchmarked against Fixed RSVP and traditional text 
presentation. No significant differences were found for reading speed and 
comprehension for long texts but for short texts all RSVP formats increased reading 
speed by 33%. For long texts Adaptive RSVP decreased task load compared to Fixed 
RSVP and repeated use of RSVP, regardless of type, was also found to decrease task 
load. No differences in task load were however found for short texts. Causes, 
implications and effects of these findings are discussed together with directions for 
further work.

Abstract. Since its inception, the field of inductive logic programming
has been centrally concerned with the use of background knowledge
in induction. Yet, surprisingly, no serious attempts have been made to
account for background knowledge in refinement operators for clauses,
even though such operators are one of the most important, prominent
and widely-used devices in the field. This paper shows how a sort theory, 
which encodes taxonomic knowledge, can be built into a downward,
subsumption-based refinement operator for clauses.

Abstract
A well known result from complex analysis allows us, under suitable circum­stances, 
to compute the number of roots of an analytic function, f(z), that lie
inside a counterclockwise, simple closed curve, C, by computing the integral,
We employ interval arithmetic and automatic differentiation to give an au­tomatic 
and guaranteed bound on the integral. Furthermore, we explore the
interplay of the choice of curve C, the location of the roots relative to C, the
number of subdivisions, and the arithmetic precision used, upon the time nec­essary

Abstract. Case-based reasoning systems solve problems by reusing a corpus of
previous problem solving experience stored as a case-base of individual
problem solving cases. In this paper we describe a new technique for
constructing compact competent case-bases. The technique is novel in its use of
an explicit model of case competence. This allows cases to be selected on the
basis of their individual competence contributions. An experimental study
shows how this technique compares favorably to more traditional strategies
across a range of standard data-sets.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe an agent­based architecture for digital library (DL) systems and its
implementation. This architecture is inspired from Harvest and UMDL, but several extensions
have been made. The most important extension concerns the building of multi­level indexing and
cataloguing. Search agents are either local or global. A global search agent interacts with other
agents of the system, and manages a set of local search agents. We extended the Z39.50 standard
in order to support the visual characteristics of images and we also integrated agents for
multilingual retrieval. This work shows that the agent­based architecture is flexible enough to
integrate various kinds of agents and services in a single system.

Abstract. This paper proposes a method of storing the proofs of the
learning examples in an efficient manner. FOIL-like top down learners
usually store the computed answers of a partially induced clause as a
set of ground substitutions. The need for the re-computation of the root
part of the SLDNF-tree is reduced that way, but the approach is space-inefficient
 when the literals in the clause are nondeterminate. We introduce a 
weak syntactic language bias that does not practically restrict the
hypothesis space. Further more, we present a proof encoding scheme, using 
a mesh-like data structure, that exploits the properties of this bias
to store the computed answers efficiently. We show that such encoding
grows at most linearly with respect to the clause length. The result is
not influenced by the presence of nondeterminism in the background
knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the problem of maintenance of a
CBR system for retrieval of rotationally symmetric shapes. The special
feature of this system is that similarity is derived primarily from graph
matching algorithms. The special problem of such a system is that it
does not operate on search indices that may be derived from single
cases and then used for visualisation and principle component analyses.
Rather, the system is built on a similarity metric defined directly over
pairs of cases. The problems of efficiency, consistency, redundancy,
completeness and correctness are discussed for such a system.
Performance measures for the CBR system are given, and the results for
trials of the system are presented. The competence of the current case-
base is discussed, with reference to a representation of cases as points in
an n-dimensional feature space, and a Gramian visualisation. A
refinement of the case base is performed as a result of the competence
analysis and the performance of the case-base before and after
refinement is compared.

"Representing and Indexing Building Refurbishment Cases for Multiple Retrieval of Adaptable Pieces of Cases

Farhi Marir and Ian Watson
Department of Surveying, University of Salford, MS 4 WT. UK.


Abstract. CBRefurb is a case-based reasoning (CBR) system for the strategic cost
estimation for building refurbishment. This domain is characterised by many uncertainties
and variation. Its cost estimation involves large amount of interrelated factors whose
impact is difficult to assess. This paper report on the problems faced by the building cost
information Services (BCIS) databases and several rule-based expert systems to tackle
this complex cost estimation problem and, the design and evaluation of CBRefurb system
implemented using ReMind Shell. CBRefurb imitates the domain expert in its approach
of breaking down the whole building work into smaller work (building items) by
organising the refurbishment cases as a hierarchical structure composed of cases and
subcases. The process of estimation imitate the expert by considering only these pieces of
previous cases of similar situation (or context). For this purpose, CBRefurb defines some
of the building and its component (or items) features as a global context and local context
information used to classify cases and subcases into context cases and subcases, and to
decompose the cost estimation problem into adaptable subproblems. This is followed by a
two indexing schemes to suit the hierarchical structure of the case and the problem
decomposition and to allow classfication and retrieval of contextual cases. CBRefurb
features consolidate the aim of the project that is allowing multiple retrieval of
appropriate pieces of the refurbishment which are easier to adapt, reflecting the expert
method of estimating cost for complex refurbishment work.

Abstract
In this paper we analyze two question
answering tasks : the TREC­8 ques­tion answering 
task and a set of reading
comprehension exams. First, we show
that Q/A systems perform better when
there are multiple answer opportunities
per question. Next, we analyze com­mon 
approaches to two subproblems:
term overlap for answer sentence iden­tification, 
and answer typing for short
answer extraction. We present general
tools for analyzing the strengths and
limitations of techniques for these sub­-problems. 
Our results quantify the limi­tations 
of both term overlap and answer
typing to distinguish between compet­ing answer candidates.

Abstract. We propose a probabilistic case-space metric for the case
matching and case adaptation tasks. Central to our approach is a probability 
propagation algorithm adopted from Bayesian reasoning systems,
which allows our case-based reasoning system to perform theoretically
sound probabilistic reasoning. The same probability propagation mechanism 
actually offers a uniform solution to both the case matching and
case adaptation problems. We also show how the algorithm can be implemented 
as a connectionist network, where efficient massively parallel
case retrieval is an inherent property of the system. We argue that using
this kind of an approach, the difficult problem of case indexing can be
completely avoided.

"On the Admissibility of Concrete Domains for CBR Based on Description Logics

Abstract. In order to use descriptions logics for case-based reasoning it must
be possible to use primitive datatypes such as numbers and strings within the
representation and inference mechanisms of the logic. The best way to do so is
via so called admissible concrete domains. In this paper we address the general
problem of the admissibility of concrete domains, using the application area of
the retrieval of bibliographic data as an example. We investigate the theoretical
limitations on admissible concrete domains over numbers and strings imposed by
decidability results known from mathematical logic and automata theory, as well
as the prospects of potential implementations in our description logic CTL.

Abstract. Recent Case-Based Reasoning research has begun to refocus
attention on the problem of automatic adaptation of the retrieved case to
give a fuller solution to the new problem. Such work has highlighted
problems with the usefulness of similarity assessment of cases where
adaptation is involved. As a response to this, methods of case selection
are evolving that take adaptation into account. This current work looks
more closely at the relationship between selection and adaptation. It
considers experimental evidence considering adaptation of multiple
cases for one problem. It argues that selection of the best case after
adaptation will often make more efficient use of case knowledge than
any attempt to pre-select a single case for adaptation.

Abstract

We have compiled a case-based retrieval system for radiology, MacRad, that is structured
around descriptors for radiology image findings. Our goal is to provide a feature-coded image
resource that allows the user to formulate image content-based queries when searching for
reference images. MacRad is implemented as a relational database with an image archive.
Each image in the library is indexed according to its radiologic content. We structured an
index for coding image content as a hierarchical image description index using the relational
format. The hierarchical index of radiologic findings allows multilevel query formulation that
depends upon the users level of experience. The system uses rules to control the search
direction within the case library and generate lists of diagnostic hypotheses for decision
support. Rules are embedded within the database structure. At present, the case library consists
of 300 cases and 3,000 images that present intracranial masses on skull X-rays, CTs, MRIs.
and angiograms.

Abstract

Developing countries still suffer lack of adequate skilled medical health personnel and poor
infrastructure. Expert systems have been identified as potential tools in addressing some
aspects of these problems. In particular, most of the earlier researchers investigated the
possibility of incorporating diagnostic-support applications in the medical work place. They
did so by using expert systems that were built around representations such as production rules,
frames, scripts and semantic networks. In this paper, a report on a different approach is given.
A MEdical Reference SYstem(MERSY) is proposed. The basis of the design of MERSY is the
case-based reasoning paradigm with some underlying domain model. This system therefore
gets around the limitations of traditional expert systems that are related to knowledge
representation and acquisition. The work also a emphasizes a high level of physical
portability, hence the relocation of expertise. It is an on-going research.

Abstract
When applying text learning algorithms to
complex tasks, it is tedious and expensive to
hand­label the large amounts of training data
necessary for good performance. This pa­per 
presents bootstrapping as an alternative
approach to learning from large sets of la­beled 
data. Instead of a large quantity of la­beled 
data, this paper advocates using a small
amount of seed information and a large collec­tion 
of easily­obtained unlabeled data. Boot­strapping 
initializes a learner with the seed in­
formation; it then iterates, applying the learner
to calculate labels for the unlabeled data, and
incorporating some of these labels into the
training input for the learner. Two case studies
of this approach are presented. Bootstrapping
for information extraction provides 76% preci­sion 
for a 250­word dictionary for extracting
locations from web pages, when starting with
just a few seed locations. Bootstrapping a text
classifier from a few keywords per class and
a class hierarchy provides accuracy of 66%, a
level close to human agreement, when placing
computer science research papers into a topic
hierarchy. The success of these two examples
argues for the strength of the general boot­
strapping approach for text learning tasks.

Abstract. Many case-based reasoning algorithms retrieve cases using a
derivative of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, whose similarity
function is sensitive to irrelevant, interacting, and noisy features. Many
proposed methods for reducing this sensitivity parameterize k-NNs similarity 
function with feature weights. We focus on methods that automatically 
assign weight settings using little or no domain-specific knowledge.
Our goal is to predict the relative capabilities of these methods for specific 
dataset characteristics. We introduce a five-dimensional framework
that categorizes automated weight-setting methods, empirically compare
methods along one of these dimensions, summarize our results with four
hypotheses, and describe additional evidence that supports them. Our
investigation revealed that most methods correctly assign low weights
to completely irrelevant features, and methods that use performance
feedback demonstrate three advantages over other methods (i.e., they
require less pre-processing, better tolerate interacting features, and increase 
learning rate).

Abstract 
Sonification is th euse of non-speech audio to convey 
information. We are developing tools for interactive
data exploration, which make use of sonification for           
data presentation. In this paper, model-based sonification
is presented as a concept to design auditory displays.        
Two designs are described: (1) particle trajectories in      
a data potential is a sonification model to reveal information
about the clustering of vectorial data and (2)          
data-sonograms is a sonification for data from a classification
problem to reveal information about the mixing of distinct classes.

Abstract

	A writing tool has been developed for helping non-native English users to produce
a first draft of Introductory Sections of scientific papers. A corpus analysis was carried
out in 54 papers of Experimental Physics which allowed one to identify the schematic
structure of Introductions and 30 rhetorical strategies generally employed. Each one of
the Introductions analysed constituted a case. The user chooses from menus features
related to the rhetorical strategies for each component and gives the intended order for
his/her Introduction, thus forming the requisition. Using three types of metric, the tool
recovers the best-match cases that can be later modified in a revision process.
Preliminary experiments showed that high precision and recall will only be obtained if
the number of cases in the case base is considerably increased. In the revision process,
four operations are suggested which consist in modifying/adding/deleting the different
rhetorical messages that constitute the strategies of the chosen case.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to acquire cases in the context
of project planning, without any extra effort from the end user. Under our
definition, a case has a one to one correspondence with the standard elements of
a project plan. We exploit this correspondence to capture cases automatically
from project planning episodes. We provide an algorithm for extracting cases
from project plans. We implemented this algorithm on top of a commercial
project-planning tool and perform experiments evaluating our approach.

"Normal Forms for Inductive Logic Programming

email Peter.Flach@kub.nl

Abstract. In this paper we study induction of unrestricted clausal theories
from interpretations. First, we show that in the propositional case induction
from complete evidence can be seen as an equivalence-preserving
transformation from DNF to CNF. From this we conclude that induction is
essentially a process of determining what is false in the domain of discourse.
We then proceed by investigating dual normal forms for evidence and
hypotheses in predicate logic. We define evidence normal form (ENE), which
is Skolemised existential DNF under a Consistent Naming Assumption.
Because ENF is incomplete, in the sense that it does not have the expressive
power of clausal logic, ENF evidence requires the identification of Skolem
terms. The approach is partly implemented in the PRIMUS system.

Abstract
This paper introduces a novel user interface that inte­grates 
search and browsing of very large category hierar­chies 
with their associated text collections. A key com­ponent 
is the separate but simultaneous display of the
representations of the categories and the retrieved doc­uments. 
Another key component is the display of mul­tiple 
selected categories simultaneously, complete with
their hierarchical context. The prototype implementa­tion 
uses animation and a three­dimensional graphical
workspace to accommodate the category hierarchy and
to store intermediate search results. Query specifica­tion 
in this 3D environment is accomplished via a novel
method for painting Boolean queries over a combination
of category labels and free text. Examples are shown
on a collection of medical text.

"Feature Construction with Inductive Logic Programming: A Study of Quantitative Predictions of Biological Activity by Structural Attributes

Abstract. Recently, computer programs developed within the field of
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have received some attention for
their ability to construct restricted first-order logic solutions using problem-specific 
background knowledge. Prominent applications of such programs
have been concerned with determining structure-activity relationships
in the areas of molecular biology and chemistry. Typically the task here
is to predict the activity of a compound, like toxicity, from its chemical
structure. Research in the area shows that: (a) ILP programs have been
restricted to qualitative predictions of activity (high, low etc.); (b)
When appropriate attributes are available, ILP programs have not been
able to better the performance of standard quantitative analysis techniques 
like linear regression. However ILP programs perform creditably
when such attributes are unavailable; and (c) When both are applicable,
ILP programs are usually slower than their propositional counterparts.
This paper examines the use of ILP programs, not for obtaining theories
complete for the sample, but as a method of discovering new attributes.
These could then be used by methods like linear regression, thus allowing
for quantitative predictions and the ability to use structural information
as background knowledge. Using structure-activity tasks as a test-bed
the utility of ILP programs in constructing new features was evaluated
by examining the prediction of chemical activity using linear regression,
with and without the aid of ILP learnt logical attributes. In three out
of the five datasets examined the addition of ILP attributes produced
statistically better results (P ¡0.01). In addition six important structural
features that have escaped the attention of the expert chemists were
discovered.

Abstract The proliferation of online information resources
increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed
searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts -- database
selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper
we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval perfor­mance. 
We look at retrieval performance in three different dis­tributed 
retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First
we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval
effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database.
Second we find that good performance can be achieved when
only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally
increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when
database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain
collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local in­
formation can be used to achieve superior performance. This
means that distributed systems can be engineered with more
autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that im­provements 
in database selection can lead to broader improve­ments 
in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single
database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good se­lection 
mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by
decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selec­tion step.

Abstract
In this paper we propose a new theoretical method for combining both content
and link structure analysis for Web information retrieval. This approach is based
on performing a random walk on a modified Markov chain, induced from the Web
graph. This new model is applicable either in a static way, where a global pres­tige 
score is computed for every document, or in a dynamic way, where the link
structure of the results from a first pass retrieval is taken into account. The results
of experiments on the TREC WT10g and .GOV collections show that it is a robust
method, particularly suitable for dynamic link analysis. Moreover, we show that it
outperforms PageRank under the same experimental settings.

"Corpus­Based Identification of Non­Anaphoric Noun Phrases

Abstract
Coreference resolution involves finding antecedents
for anaphoric discourse entities, such as definite
noun phrases. But many definite noun phrases are
not anaphoric because their meaning can be un­derstood 
from general world knowledge (e.g., ``the
White House'' or ``the news media''). We have
developed a corpus­based algorithm for automat­ically 
identifying definite noun phrases that are
non­anaphoric, which has the potential to improve
the efficiency and accuracy of coreference resolu­tion 
systems. Our algorithm generates lists of non­
anaphoric noun phrases and noun phrase patterns
from a training corpus and uses them to recognize
non­anaphoric noun phrases in new texts. Using
1600 MUC­4 terrorism news articles as the training
corpus, our approach achieved 78% recall and 87%
precision at identifying such noun phrases in 50 test
documents.

"Integrating Rule Induction and Case-Based Reasoning to Enhance Problem Solving

Aijun An, Nick Cercone and Christine Chan

University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada S4S 0A2


Abstract. We present a new method that integrates rule induction and
case-based reasoning. The method is new in two aspects. First, it applies
a novel feature weighting function for assessing similarities between cases.
By using this weighting function, optimal case retrieval is achieved in that
the most relevant cases can be retrieved from the case base. Second, the
method handles both classification and numeric prediction tasks under a
mixed paradigm of rule-based and case-based reasoning. Before problem
solving, rule induction is performed to induce a set of decision rules from
a set of training data. The rules are then employed to determine some
parameters in the new weighting function. The induced rules are also
used to detect possible noise in the training set so that noisy cases are not
used in case-based reasoning. For classification tasks, rules are applied to
make decisions; if there is a conflict between matched rules, case-based
reasoning is performed. The method was implemented in ELEM2-CBR, a
learning and problem solving system. We demonstrate the performance
of ELEM2-CBR by comparing it with other methods on a number of
designed and real-world problems.

"Cautious Induction in Inductive Logic Programming

Simon Anthony and Alan M. Frisch

Department of Computer Science, University of York, York. YO1 5DD. UK.
Email: {simona, frisch}@cs.york.ac.uk


Abstract. Many top-down Inductive Logic Programming systems use a
greedy, covering approach to construct hypotheses. This paper presents
an alternative, cautious approach, known as cautious induction. We conjecture 
that cautious induction can allow better hypotheses to be found,
with respect to some hypothesis quality criteria. This conjecture is supported 
by the presentation of an algorithm called CILS, and with a complexity 
analysis and empirical comparison of CILS with the Progol system. 
The results are encouraging and demonstrate the applicability of
cautious induction to problems with noisy datasets, and to problems
which require large, complex hypotheses to be learnt.

"Loose Coupling of Failure Explanation and Repair: sing Learning Goals to Sequence Learning Methods

Michael T. Cox
Computer Science Department. Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3891
mcox@cs.cmu.edu


Abstract. Because learning methods (i.e., knowledge repairs) can negatively interact, the
arbitrary ordering of knowledge repairs can lead to worse system performance than no
learning at all. Therefore, the problem of choosing appropriate learning methods given a
performance failure is a significant problem for learning systems. Traditional case-based
reasoners index learning or repair methods by specific failure characteristics so that once a
failure is detected, a learning method can be brought to bear. Such tight coupling can be
contrasted to a loose coupling in which the interaction between failure explanation and
learning is mediated by the presence of learning goals generated by the learner. In an
empirical study, the Meta-AQUA implementation performed significantly better under the
guidance of learning goals (loose coupling) than under a condition in which learning goals
were ablated (tight coupling). The conclusion is that unless repair interactions are known
not to exist, a loose coupling is necessary for effective learning.

"Structural Similarity as Guidance in Case-Based Design *

Katy Börner

P.O.Box 66, 04251 Leipzig, FRG
katy@informatik.th-leipzig.de



Abstract. This paper presents a novel approach to determine structural
similarity as guidance for adaptation in case-based reasoning (CBR). We
advance structural similarity assessment which provides not only a single
numeric value but the most specific structure two cases have in common,
inclusive of the modification rules needed to obtain this structure from
the two cases. Our approach treats retrieval, matching, and adaptation
as a group of dependent processes. This guarantees the retrieval and
matching of not only similar but adaptable cases. Both together enlarge
the overall problem solving performance of CBR and the explainability
of case selection and adaptation considerably. Although our approach
is more theoretical in nature and not restricted to a specific domain,
we will give an example taken from the domain of industrial building
design. Additionally, we will sketch two prototypical implementations of
the approach.

"Active Exploration in Instance-Based Preference Modeling

Abstract. Knowledge of the preferences of individual users is essential 
for intelligent systems whose performance is tailored for individual 
users, such as agents that interact with human users, instructional
environments, and learning apprentice systems. Various memory-based,
instance-based, and case-based systems have been developed for preference 
modeling, but these system have generally not addressed the task
of selecting examples to use as queries to the user. This paper describes
UGAMA, an approach to learning preference criteria through active exploration. 
Under this approach, Unit Gradient Approximations (UGAs)
of the underlying quality function are obtained at a set of reference points
through a series of queries to the user. Equivalence sets of UGAs are then
merged and aligned (MA) with the apparent boundaries between linear
regions. In an empirical evaluation with artificial data, use of UGAs as
training data for an instance-based ranking algorithm (1ARC) led to
more accurate ranking than training with random instances, and use of
UGAMA led to greater ranking accuracy than UGAs alone.

"Some Limitations of Feature-Based Recognition in Case-Based Design

Thomas R. Hinriche

Abstract. A crucial part of Case-Based Reasoning is retrieving cases
that are similar or otherwise relevant to the problem at hand. Traditionally, 
this has been formulated as a problem of indexing and accessing
cases based on sets of predictive features. More generally, however, we
can think of retrieval as a problem of recognition. In this light, several
limitations of the feature-based approach become apparent. What constitutes 
a feature? What makes a feature predictive? And how is retrieval
possible when the structure of an input is predictive, but its components
are not?
	This paper presents an analysis of some of the limitations of feature-based 
recognition and describes a process that integrates structural recognition 
with retrieval. This structural recognition algorithm is designed
to augment the retrieval capabilities of case-based reasoners by facilitating 
the recognition of functional design clichés, natural laws, and sub
problems for which individual features may not be predictive.

ABSTRACT
Musical signals exhibit periodic temporal structure that create
the sensation of rhythm. In order to model, analyze, and retrieve
musical signals it is important to automatically extract rhythmic
information. To somewhat simplify the problem, automatic algo­rithms 
typically only extract information about the main beat of
the signal which can be loosely defined as the regular periodic se­quence 
of pulses corresponding to where a human would tap his
foot while listening to the music. In these algorithms, the beat is
characterized by its frequency (tempo), phase (accent locations)
and a confidence measure about its detection.
The main focus of this paper is the concept of Beat Strength,
which will be loosely defined as one rhythmic characteristic that
could allow to discriminate between two pieces of music having
the same tempo. Using this definition, we might say that a piece
of Hard Rock has a higher beat strength than a piece of Classical
Music at the same tempo. Characteristics related to Beat Strength
have been implicitely used in automatic beat detection algorithms
and shown to be as important as tempo information for music clas­sification 
and retrieval. In the work presented in this paper, a user
study exploring the perception of Beat Strength was conducted
and the results were used to calibrate and explore automatic Beat
Strength measures based on the calculation of Beat Histograms.

"Improving Case-Based Recommendation A Collaborative Filtering Approach

Abstract. Data Mining, or Knowledge Discovery as it is also known, is becoming 
increasingly useful in a wide variety of applications. In the following paper,
we look at its use in combating some of the traditional issues faced with recommender 
systems. We discuss our ongoing work which aims to enhance the
performance of PTV, an applied recommender system working in the TV listings 
domain. This system currently combines the results of separate user-based
collaborative and case-based components to recommend programs to users. Our
extension to this idea operates on the theory of developing a case-based view of
the collaborative component itself. By using data mining techniques to extract
relationships between programme items, we can address the sparsity/maintenance
problem. We also adopt a unique approach to recommendation ranking which
combines user similarities and item similarities to provide more effective recommendation 
orderings. Experimental results corroborate our ideas, demonstrating
the effectiveness of data mining in improving recommender systems by providing
similarity knowledge to address sparsity, both at user-based recommendation level
and recommendation ranking level.

Abstract. As CBR system designers confront the problem of building programs 
that can explain their results, a logical representation of relevance
concepts will be useful. Our application, tutoring students to reason with
cases, necessitated adopting a declarative, logical representation of case-based 
relevance concepts. Representing relevance criteria in first-order logic
with LOOM has turned out not to be prohibitively expensive computationally 
and has had considerable advantages: it facilitates the use of multiple,
changing relevance criteria involving complex relationships among cases, we
have made some progress in enabling a program to explain aspects of its relevance 
criteria by example, and even students are beginning to express their
own queries in a simplified version of the language for CATO, our tutoring
program, to interpret.

Abstract
The model of arithmetic branching programs is an algebraic model of computation
generalizing the model of modular branching programs. We show that, up to a poly­nomial 
factor in size, arithmetic branching programs are equivalent to complements of
dependency programs, a model introduced by Pudl'ak and Sgall [20]. Using this equiv­alence 
we prove that dependency programs are closed under conjunction over every
field, answering an open problem of [20]. Furthermore, we show that span programs,
an algebraic model of computation introduced by Karchmer and Wigderson [16], are
at least as strong as arithmetic programs; every arithmetic program can be simulated
by a span program of size not more than twice the size of the arithmetic program.
Using the above results we give a new proof that NL/poly ` \PhiL/poly, first proved by
Wigderson [25]. Our simulation of NL/poly is more efficient, and it holds for logspace
counting classes over every field.

Abstract. This paper presents a hybrid case-based reasoning (CBR)
and information retrieval (IR) system, called SPIRE, that both retrieves
documents from a full-text document corpus and from within individual 
documents, and locates passages likely to contain information about
important problem-solving features of cases. SPIRE uses two case-bases,
one containing past precedents, and one containing excerpts from past
case texts. Both are used by SPIRE to automatically generate queries,
which are then run by the INQUERY full-text retrieval engine on a large
text collection in the case of document retrieval and on individual text
documents for passage retrieval.

Abstract. Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems solve new problems by retrieving 
stored prior cases, and adapting their solutions to fit new circumstances. Traditionally, 
CBR systems draw their cases from a single local case-base tailored
to their task. However, when a systems own set of cases is limited, it may be
beneficial to supplement the local case-base with cases drawn from external case-bases 
for related tasks. Effective use of external case-bases requires strategies for
multi-case-base reasoning (MCBR): (1) for deciding when to dispatch problems
to an external case-base, and (2) for performing cross-case-base adaptation to
compensate for differences in the tasks and environments that each case-base reflects. 
This paper presents methods for automatically tuning MCBR systems by
selecting effective dispatching criteria and cross-case-base adaptation strategies.
The methods require no advance knowledge of the task and domain: they perform
tests on an initial set of problems and use the results to select strategies reflecting
the characteristics of the local and external case-bases. We present experimental
illustrations of the performance of the tuning methods for a numerical prediction
task, and demonstrate that a small sample set can be sufficient to make high-quality
choices of dispatching and cross-case-base adaptation strategies.

Abstract. While the problem of learning logic programs has been extensively 
studied in ILP, the problem of learning in description logics (DLs)
has been tackled mostly by empirical means. Learning in DLs is however 
worthwhile, since both Horn logic and description logics are widely
used knowledge representation formalisms, their expressive powers being
incomparable (neither includes the other as a fragment). Unlike most approaches 
to learning in description logics, which provide bottom-up (and
typically overly specific) least generalizations of the examples, this paper 
addresses learning in DLs using downward (and upward) refinement
operators. Technically, we construct a complete and proper refinement
operator for the ALER description logic (to avoid overfitting, we disallow 
disjunctions from the target DL). Although no minimal refinement
operators exist for ALER, we show that we can achieve minimality of
all refinement steps, except the ones that introduce the I concept. We
additionally prove that complete refinement operators for ALER cannot
be locally finite and suggest how this problem can be overcome by an
MDL search heuristic. We also discuss the influence of the Open World
Assumption (typically made in DLs) on example coverage.

Abstract
We describe an unsupervised
semantic tagger, applied to German,
but which could be used with any
language for which a corresponding
""XNet"" (WordNet, GermaNet, etc.),
POS tagger and morphological
analyzer are available.
Disambiguation is performed by
comparing co­occurrence weights on
pairs of semantic classes (synsets
from GermaNet). Precision is around
67% at a recall of around 65% (for all
ambiguous words ­­ 81% for all words
at a recall of 80%). Our results show
the influence of context size and of
semantic class frequency in the
training corpus.

"Little Words Can Make a Big Difference for Text Classification

E­mail: riloff@cs.utah.edu

Abstract
Most information retrieval systems use stopword lists
and stemming algorithms. However, we have found
that recognizing singular and plural nouns, verb forms,
negation, and prepositions can produce dramatically
different text classification results. We present results
from text classification experiments that compare rel­evancy 
signatures, which use local linguistic context,
with corresponding indexing terms that do not. In two
different domains, relevancy signatures produced better
results than the simple indexing terms. These experi­ments 
suggest that stopword lists and stemming algo­
rithms may remove or conflate many words that could
be used to create more effective indexing terms.

We discuss the integration of          visualization and      supercomputing in a low cost     
environment. Computational requirements continue to increase dramatically as                   
computational capabilities do. Yet most architectures still separate both processes. The       
computation is done on one system and the visualization on another. We describe an             
innovative architecture developed by the Supercomputer Research Center of the Institute        
for Defense Analysis within which the integration of visualization and                         
supercomputation is realized. Immediate gains are obvious: program visualization,              
real-time computational steering, and rapid porting of current applications. We                
describe the issues in porting our experimental visualization          software1,2,7 and issues
e encountered. We describe limitations and advantages of the hardware/software

"Evaluating the Application of CBR in Mesh Design for Simulation Problems

Neil Hurley
Hitachi Dublin Laboratory. Trinity College Dublin 2, IRELAND
(E-mail: nhurley@hdl.ie)

Abstract. One of the great difficulties facing a designer of a knowledge-based
interface to a numerical simulation engine is acquiring sufficient domain
knowledge to cover a significant range of problems to a depth that will make the
system useful for real problem-solving. It is difficult to enumerate a priori all the
different scenarios which may be encountered and to devise rules to cater for each.
Indeed, it is true to say that often the tuneable parameters of a numerical algorithm
(such as the error tolerance in a matrix inversion technique or the mesh density in
a finite element analysis) are determined on a trial and error basis when the
problem is first encountered. Setting up a knowledge-base therefore requires a lot
of time-consuming experimentation over a range of different problems. There is
no easy way to avoid this knowledge acquisition task if a robust system to tackle
real-world problems is to be created. Furthermore, we must accept that the system
at some stage is likely to encounter problems outside its coverage. It is therefore
worthwhile examining alternative reasoning techniques which can be utilised
when domain knowledge is lacking, as well as ways that new knowledge can be
incorporated into the knowledge-base as problem-solving takes place. Towards
this end, we have examined the application of case-based reasoning (CBR) to
finite element simulation and in particular to the sub-task of finite element mesh
design. In [5] a CBR approach to mesh design was outlined. In the current paper
we evaluate that system, assess its performance at problem solving, discuss the
lessons learned from its development and what implications these have for CBR in
general.

Abstract. Recent research activities in the field of attribute selection for
carrying on dialogs with on-line customers have focused on entropy-based
approaches that make use of information gain measures. These measures
consider the distribution of attribute values in the case base and are focused on
their ability to reduce dialog length. The implicit knowledge contained in the
similarity measures is neglected. In previous work, we proposed the similarity-influenced 
selection method sim Var, which selects the attributes that induce the
maximum change in similarity distribution amongst the candidate cases,
thereby partitioning the case base into similar and dissimilar cases. In this paper
we present an evaluation of the selection methods using three domains with
distinct characteristics. The comparison of the selection methods is based on the
quality of the dialogs generated. Statistical analysis was used to support the
evaluation results.

"On the use of CBR in optimisation problems such as the TSP

Pádraig Cunningham *, Barry Smyth **, Neil Hurley **

Abstract. The particular strength of CBR is normally considered to be its use in
weak theory domains where solution quality is compiled into cases and is
reusable. In this paper we explore an alternative use of CBR in optimisation
problems where cases represent highly optimised structures in a huge highly
constrained solution space. Our analysis focuses on the Travelling Salesman
Problem where difficulty arises from the computational complexity of the
problem rather than any difficulty associated with the domain theory. We find
that CBR is good for producing medium quality solutions in very quick time. We
have difficulty getting CBR to produce high quality solutions because solution
quality seems to be lost in the adaptation process. We also argue that experiments
with CBR on transparent problems such as the TSP tell us a lot about aspects of
CBR such as; the quality of CBR solutions, the coverage that cases in the case-base 
offer and the utility of extending a case-base.

Abstract. Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems engage their
users in a series of questions and answers and present them with cases that are
most applicable to their decision problem. In previous research, we introduced
the Taxonomic CCBR methodology, an extension of standard CCBR that
improved performance by organizing features related by abstraction into
taxonomies. We recently extended this methodology to include causal relations
between taxonomies and claimed that it could yield additional performance
gains. In this paper, we formalize the causal extension of Taxonomic CCBR,
called Causal CCBR, and empirically assess its benefits using a new
methodology for evaluating CCBR performance. Evaluation of Taxonomic and
Causal CCBR systems in troubleshooting and customer support domains
demonstrates that they significantly outperform the standard CCBR approach.
In addition, Causal CCBR outperforms Taxonomic CCBR to the extent causal
relations are incorporated in the case bases.

"Applying Machine Translation to Two­Stage Cross­Language Information Retrieval

Abstract. Cross­language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries
and documents are in different languages, needs a translation of queries
and/or documents, so as to standardize both of them into a common
representation. For this purpose, the use of machine translation is an
effective approach. However, computational cost is prohibitive in trans­lating 
large­scale document collections. To resolve this problem, we pro­
pose a two­stage CLIR method. First, we translate a given query into the
document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign documents.
Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user lan­guage, 
and re­rank them based on the translation result. We also show
the effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese
queries and English technical documents.

Abstract
We propose a method to generate large­scale
encyclopedic knowledge, which is valuable
for much NLP research, based on the Web.
We first search the Web for pages contain­ing 
a term in question. Then we use lin­guistic 
patterns and HTML structures to ex­tract 
text fragments describing the term. Fi­nally, 
we organize extracted term descrip­tions 
based on word senses and domains. In
addition, we apply an automatically gener­ated 
encyclopedia to a question answering
system targeting the Japanese Information­
Technology Engineers Examination.

Abstract. With the dramatic proliferation of case based reasoning systems 
in commercial applications, many case bases are now becoming
legacy systems. They represent a significant portion of an organizations
assets, but they are large and difficult to maintain. One of the contributing 
factors is that these case bases are often large and yet unstructured;
they are represented in natural language text. Adding to the complexity
is the fact that the case bases are often authored and updated by different 
people from a variety of knowledge sources, making it highly likely
for a case base to contain redundant and inconsistent knowledge.
In this paper, we present methods and a system for maintaining large
and unstructured case bases. We focus on two difficult problems in case-base 
maintenance: redundancy and inconsistency detection. These two
problems are particularly pervasive when one deals with an unstructured
case base. We will discuss both algorithms and a system for solving these
problems. As the ability to contain the knowledge acquisition problem
is of paramount importance, our methods allow one to express relevant
domain expertise for detecting both redundancy and inconsistency naturally 
and effortlessly. Empirical evaluations of the system prove the
effectiveness of the methods in several large domains.

"Learning Functions Represented as Multiplicity Automata \Lambda

Amos Beimel y Francesco Bergadano z Nader H. Bshouty x
Eyal Kushilevitz -- Stefano Varricchio k
April 23, 1998

Abstract
We study the learnability of multiplicity automata in Angluin's exact learning
model, and we investigate its applications. Our starting point is a known theorem
from automata theory relating the number of states in a minimal multiplicity automa­ton 
for a function to the rank of its Hankel matrix. With this theorem in hand we
present a new simple algorithm for learning multiplicity automata with improved time
and query complexity, and we prove the learnability of various concept classes. These
include (among others):
ffl The class of disjoint DNF, and more generally satisfy­O(1) DNF.
ffl The class of polynomials over finite fields.
ffl The class of bounded­degree polynomials over infinite fields.
ffl The class of XOR of terms.
ffl Certain classes of boxes in high dimensions.
In addition, we obtain the best query complexity for several classes known to be learn­able 
by other methods such as decision trees and polynomials over GF(2).
While multiplicity automata are shown to be useful to prove the learnability of
some subclasses of DNF formulae and various other classes, we study the limitations
of this method. We prove that this method cannot be used to resolve the learnability
of some other open problems such as the learnability of general DNF formulae or even
k­term DNF for k = !(log n) or satisfy­s DNF formulae for s = !(1). These results are
proven by exhibiting functions in the above classes that require multiplicity automata
with super­polynomial number of states.

Abstract. This paper describes a quality management system (called CBQM: Case-Based 
Quality Management) using the case-based reasoning mechanism which is
based on a cost expectation value. The cost expectation value is calculated from
objective and subjective values. We developed a quality management system that
employs a stochastic method. However, in some cases, this stochastic-based system
failed to select good cases. Therefore, we have integrated some expectation values
into the case selection mechanism. The CBQM has an expectation measurement. Its
case selection criteria use not only similarity, but also some expectation values, If
unforeseen malfunctions may occur due to inappropriate design, manufacturing
condition and/or unsuitable usage, the similarity is not enough to select useful cases
from a casebase. That is because the similarity is mainly based on products
themselves. The CBQM adopts the cost expectation value in order to pick up useful
cases. The CBQMs selection criteria is based on the quality of cases, which considers
repair time, repair part cost, trouble recurrence, the confidence of diagnosis and repair
difficulty. We validated this system in real product repair problems which field service
engineers repair home appliances.

"Chord: A Scalable Peer­to­peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications

Abstract
A fundamental problem that confronts peer­to­peer applications is
to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This
paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses
this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given
a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily
implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data
item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the
key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the
system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously
changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex­periments 
show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost
and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with
the number of Chord nodes.

"Clustering Large Datasets in Arbitrary Metric Spaces

Venkatesh Ganti \Lambda Raghu Ramakrishnan Johannes Gehrke y
Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin­Madison

Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville

Abstract
Clustering partitions a collection of objects into groups
called clusters, such that similar objects fall into the same
group. Similarity between objects is defined by a distance
function satisfying the triangle inequality; this distance
function along with the collection of objects describes a dis­tance 
space. In a distance space, the only operation possi­ble 
on data objects is the computation of distance between
them. All scalable algorithms in the literature assume a spe­cial 
type of distance space, namely a k­dimensional vector
space, which allows vector operations on objects.
We present two scalable algorithms designed for cluster­
ing very large datasets in distance spaces. Our first algo­rithm 
BUBBLE is, to our knowledge, the first scalable clus­tering 
algorithm for data in a distance space. Our second
algorithm BUBBLE­FM improves upon BUBBLE by reduc­ing 
the number of calls to the distance function, which may
be computationally very expensive. Both algorithms make
only a single scan over the database while producing high
clustering quality. In a detailed experimental evaluation,
we study both algorithms in terms of scalability and quality
of clustering. We also show results of applying the algo­rithms 
to a real­life dataset.

Abstract. In this paper we examine the problem of repairing incomplete
background knowledge using Theory Recovery. Repeat Learning under
ILP considers the problem of updating background knowledge in order to
progressively increase the performance of an ILP algorithm as it tackles
a sequence of related learning problems. Theory recovery is suggested as
a suitable mechanism. A bound is derived for the performance of theory
recovery in terms of the information content of the missing predicate definitions. 
Experiments are described that use the logical back-propagation
ability of Progol 5.0 to perform theory recovery. The experimental results
are consistent with the derived bound.

Complex systems abound in nature and are becoming increasingly                                                               
important in artificial systems. The understanding and controlling                                                           
of such systems is a major challenge. This paper tries to take a

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis of peer­to­peer (P2P)
networks operating in the face of concurrent joins and unexpected
departures. We focus on Chord, a recently developed P2P system
that implements a distributed hash table abstraction, and study the
process by which Chord maintains its distributed state as nodes join
and leave the system. We argue that traditional performance mea­sures 
based on run­time are uninformative for a continually running
P2P network, and that the rate at which nodes in the network need
to participate to maintain system state is a more useful metric. We
give a general lower bound on this rate for a network to remain con­nected, 
and prove that an appropriately modified version of Chord's
maintenance rate is within a logarithmic factor of the optimum rate.

Abstract. This paper presents an application of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) and Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) to the problem of Thai
character recognition. In such a learning problem, there exist several different
classes of examples; there are 77 different Thai characters. Using examples
constructed from character images, ILP learns 77 rules each of which defines
each character. However, some unseen character images, especially the noisy
images, may not exactly match any learned rule, i.e., they may not be covered
by any rule. Therefore, a method for approximating the rule that best matches
the unseen data is needed. Here we employ BNN for finding such rules.
Experimental results on noisy data show that the accuracy of rules learned by
ILP without the help of BNN is comparable to other methods. Furthermore,
combining BNN with ILP yields the significant improvement and surpasses the
other methods tested in our experiment.

1 Motivation

In our research work, we have come to represent cases as complex, structured data
structures that we will formally described as feature terms (see [Arcos] for a description of
the NOOS language for CBR and multistrategy leaming). The advantage of using
structured representations are twofold. Firstly, it offers a natural way to describe composite
objects that if described by attribute-value representations cause some problems like dealing
with irrelevant attributes, not-applicable values, etc (and this leads to problems when
comparing similitude among cases in this descriptions). Secondly. structured-
representation cases offer the capability of treating subparts of cases also as full-fledged
cases: they can be stored, and retrieved and used to solve (sub)problems of new cases;
also, a case may be solved using (subparts ot) multiple cases retneved from the systems
memory. We will present here a formalization of structured (sometimes called object-centered) 
representations as feature terms and we will present how can we assess similarity
between feature terms (cases) and determine the preferred (most similar) case from a set of
cases.

Abstract. Current implementation of coverage check for evaluating the
candidate hypothesis in A* -like search in Progol is based on backward
reasoning of Prolog. But it contains some kinds of redundancy. In this
paper, we propose an alternative algorithm based on forward reasoning 
of extended MGTP (Model Generation Theorem Prover). Since this
alternative can remove the redundant computations, we can expect to
realize a more efficient search process.

Abstract
Knowledge­based natural language processing systems have
achieved good success with certain tasks but they are of­
ten criticized because they depend on a domain­ specific
dictionary that requires a great deal of manual knowledge
engineering. This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes
knowledge­based NLP systems impractical for real ­world
applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported
to new domains. In response to this problem, we devel­
oped a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a
domain ­specific dictionary of concepts for extracting infor­mation 
from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictio­nary 
for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5
person­hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary
with a hand­crafted dictionary that was built by two highly
skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500
person­hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries
using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the
AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of
the hand­crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the Auto­

Abstract
A new multicomputer performance monitoring system is described in this     
paper.  Where possible, the system employs portable performance monitoring instrumentation                            
technology and leverages previous work.  Trace event acquisition is hardware assisted and                            
based on the MultiKron, a single chip measurement solution developed at the National             
Institute for Standards and Technology .  The user interface is based on the Pablo Performance                       
Analysis Environment, a visualization and sonification toolkit developed at the University of                         
Illinois.  The SPIscope is introduced as a component that bridges the gap between these            
emerging standard interfaces.  The SPIscope provides a high bandwidth path to a large                                 
secondary storage for recording performance data.  Connectivity to the user's performance     
analysis workstation is via a TCP/IP LAN.  Facilities are provided to support                                         
application±specific trace events, breakpoint style debugging, on line transmission of selected                       
data, and dynamic acquisition±rate control.  By using existing technology and interfaces, we                          
hope to contribute a performance monitoring component with greater utility throughout the                             
parallel processing community .

"Refining Conversational Case Libraries

{aha,breslow}@aic.nrl.navy.mil



Abstract. Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) shells (e.g., Inferences 
CBR Express) are commercially successful tools for supporting
the development of help desk and related applications. In contrast to
rule-based expert systems, they capture knowledge as cases rather than
more problematic rules, and they can be incrementally extended. However, 
rather than eliminate the knowledge engineering bottleneck, they
refocus it on case engineering, the task of carefully authoring cases according 
to library design guidelines to ensure good performance. Designing 
complex libraries according to these guidelines is difficult; software is
needed to assist users with case authoring. We describe an approach for
revising case libraries according to design guidelines, its implementation
in CLIRE, and empirical results showing that, under some conditions, this
approach can improve conversational CBR performance.

Abstract. In this paper Description Logics are presented as a suitable
formalism to model the CBR life cycle. We propose a general model
to structure the knowledge needed in a CBR system, where adaptation
knowledge is explicitly represented. Next, the CBR processes are described 
based on this model and the CBR system OoFRA is presented
as an example of our approach.

"Function-Free Horn Clauses Are Hard to Approximate

{nock,jappy}@lirmm.fr



Abstract. In this paper, we show two hardness results for approximating 
the best function-free Horn clause by an element of the same class.
Our first result shows that for some constant k > 0, the error rate of the
best k-Horn clause cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within
any constant factor by an element of the same class. Our second result is
much stronger. Under some frequently encountered complexity hypothesis, 
we show that if we replace the constant number of Horn clauses
by a small, poly-logarithmic number, the constant factor blows up exponentially 
to a quasi-polynomial factor nlogk n,, where n is the number of
predicates of the problem, a measure of its complexity. Our main result
links the difficulty of error approximation with the number of clauses allowed. 
We finally give an outline of the incidence of our result on systems
that learn using ILP (Inductive Logic Programming) formalism.

"Efficient Ø-Subsumption Based on Graph Algorithms

Abstract. The Ø-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of
ILP learning systems. We discuss two Ø-subsumption algorithms based on
strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals. The class of clauses,
for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic 
clauses. We further map the general problem of Ø-subsumption
to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and
in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Carraghan 
and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of
the subsumption search space. We also present empirical results for the
mesh design data set.

"Case-Based Planning to Learn

Abstract. Learning can be viewed as a problem of planning a series of
modifications to memory. We adopt this view of learning and propose
the applicability of the case-based planning methodology to the task of
planning to learn. We argue that relatively simple, fine-grained primitive
inferential operators are needed to support flexible planning. We show
that it is possible to obtain the benefits of case-based reasoning within
a planning to learn framework.

Abstract. As part of our investigation of how abstract principles are
operationalized to facilitate their application to specific fact situations, we
have begun to develop and experiment with SIROCCO (System for
Intelligent Retrieval of Operationalized Cases and COdes), a CBR retrieval
and analysis system applied to the domain of engineering ethics. SIROCCO
is intended to retrieve decided engineering ethics cases and previously
applied ethics codes to assist engineers and students in analyzing new cases.
Here we describe a limited but expressive language designed to represent a
wide range of ethics cases in SIROCCO, a world-wide web tool developed to
perform case acquisition and support a measure of consistency in
representation, and an experiment to validate the initial phase of
SIROCCOs retrieval algorithm and test its sensitivity to small variations in
case description.

"Collaborative Maintenance  A Distributed, Interactive Case-Base Maintenance Strategy

Maria Angela Ferrario and Barry Smyth

Smart Media Institute, Department of Computer Science, University College Dublin

{maria.ferrario,barry.smyth}@ucd.ie



Abstract. Case-base maintenance is an important emerging issue for
case-base reasoners as they scale-up to handle real-world problems in
unstable environments. Overtime the contents of a case-base may
become out-of-date or inconsistent with the current target problem
space, and maintenance strategies must be devised to help recognise
and repair these problems, by deleting, adding, or modifying cases, for
example. In this paper we describe a maintenance framework called
collaborative maintenance (CM), which has been designed to facilitate,
monitor, and control the incremental up-date of live, dynamic case-bases. 
Our approach is novel in that it automatically supports a
distributed, interactive maintenance process  users are permitted to
recommend case updates and the collaborative maintenance process
ensures that these recommendations are properly reviewed and
actioned.

Abstract
Object identification techniques have wide applications 
ranging from industry, business, military, law
enforcement, to people's daily life. With the fast development 
in e-business, its applications in internet
related business and commercial models have also been
witnessed to grow fast. This work is motivated to develop 
a new theory for appearance based object identification with 
its applications in different areas.
Although many successful techniques have been proposed in 
certain specific applications, object identification, 
in general, still remains as a diÆcult and
challenging problem. In appearance based approaches,
typical methods include eigenfaces and the related
subspace analysis, singular value decomposition, Gabor 
wavelet features, neural networks, and shape and
appearance-based probabilistic models. All these methods 
are based on a fundamen tal assumption, i.e., all
the images (both in the model base and to be queried)
are in the same dimensions, so that the feature vectors
are all in the same feature space; if images are provided
with different dimensions, a normalization in scale to
a pre-determined image space must be conducted.
In this research, a theory for appearance based object identication 
called subspace morphing is developed, which allows scale-invariant 
identification of images of objects, and therefore, does not require 
normalization. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation 
show that in the situation where images are
provided in different dimensions, which is common in
many applications, subspace morphing theory is superior 
to the existing, normalization-based techniques in
performance.

Abstract. The development of successful case-based design aids depends 
both on the CBR processes themselves and on crucial questions of
integrating the CBR system into the larger task context: how to make the
CBR component provide information at the right time and in the right
form, how to access relevant information from additional information
sources to supplement the case library, how to capture information for
use downstream and how to unobtrusively acquire new cases. This paper
presents a set of design principles and techniques that integrate methods 
from CBR and information retrieval to address these questions. The
paper illustrates their application through a case study of the Stamping
Advisor, a tool to support feasibility analysis for stamped metal automotive parts.

ABSTRACT
The concept of a weakly intrusive ambient soundscape WI(SP) is   
presented as a means to provide a peripheral awareness of processes 
beyond a user's immediate attention. The WISP is a component 
in a larger environment for ubiquitous computing, centered 
around a conference room scenario. The experiences from   
a demonstration prototype indicate that the choice of sounds and                
the intensity of their presentation can greatly influence the way
theWISP is perceived. The work relates in various ways to the   
sonification of data and audio-based techniques for maintaining 
peripheral awareness.

"Using Case Data to Improve on Rule-based Function Approximation

Abstract. The regression problem is to approximate a function from
sample values. Decision trees and decision rules achieve this task by
finding regions with constant function values. While recursive partitioning 
methods are strong in dynamic feature selection and in explanatory
capabilities, an essential weakness of these methods is the approximation
of a region by a constant value. We propose a new method that relies
on searching for similar cases to boost performance. The new method
preserves the strengths of the partitioning schemes while compensating
for the weaknesses that are introduced with constant-value regions. Our
method relies on searching for the most relevant cases using a rule-based
system, and then using these cases for determining the function value.
Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can often yield
superior regression performance.

"A Logical Database Mining Query Language

Luc De Raedt

Institut für Informatik, Albert-Ludwig-University
Universitätsgelände Flugplatz

deraedt@informatik.uni-freiburg.de



Abstract. A novel query language for database mining, called RDM,
is presented. RDM provides primitives for discovering frequent patterns
and association rules, for manipulating example sets, for performing 
predictive and descriptive induction and for reasoning about the generality
of hypotheses. RDM is designed for querying deductive databases and
employs principles from inductive logic programming. Therefore RDM
allows to query patterns that involve multiple relations as well as 
background knowledge. The embedding of RDM within a programming 
language such as PROLOG puts database mining on similar grounds as
constraint programming. An operational semantics for RDM is outlined
and an efficient algorithm for solving RDM queries is presented. This
solver integrates Mitchells versionspace approach with the well-known
APRIORI algorithm by Agrawal et al.

"Towards using a Single Uniform Metric in Instance-Based Learning

Kai Ming Ting

Basser Department of Computer Science
University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia


Abstract. In instance-based learning, two different metrics are usually
used for continuous-valued attributes and nominal attributes. The problem 
of using different metrics in domains which have both types of attribute 
has been mitigated by methods such as attribute and instance
weightings in instance-based learning.
This paper investigates a method that treats both types of attribute
using a single uniform metric in instance-based learning. The method
transforms continuous-valued attributes into nominal attributes through
discretisation at the outset. We empirically examine the approach using
both real-world and artificial datasets to characterise the benefits of discretisation 
and using a single uniform metric in instance-based learning.
Results indicate that our approach can be beneficial to instance-based
learning in domains which have noise or irrelevant attributes.

Abstract. The principles of instance based function learning are presented. 
In IBFL one is given a set of positive examples of a functional
predicate. These examples are true ground facts that illustrate the input 
output behaviour of the predicate. The purpose is then to predict
the output of the predicate given a new input. Further assumptions are
that there is no background theory and that the inputs and outputs
of the predicate consist of structured terms. IBFL is a novel technique
that addresses this problem and that combines ideas from instance based
learning, first order distances and analogical or case based reasoning. We
also argue that IBFL is especially useful when there is a need for handling
complex and deeply nested terms. Though we present the technique in
isolation, it might be more useful as a component of a larger system to
deal e.g. with the logic, language and learning challenge.

Abstract. In this paper, we propose a thorough investigation of a nearest 
neighbor rule wbich we call the Symmetric Nearest Neighbor (sNN)
rule. Basically, it symmetrises the classical nearest neighbor relationship
from which are computed the points voting for some instance. Experiments 
on 29 datasets, most of which are readily available, show that
thc method significantly outperforms the traditional Nearest Neighbors
methods. Experiments on a domain of interest related to tropical pollution 
normalization also show the greater potential of this method. We
finally discuss the reasons for the mules efficiency, provide methods for
speeding-up the classification time, and derive from the sNN rule a reliable 
and fast algorithm to fix the parameter k in the k-NN rule, a
longstanding problem in this field.

Abstract
Cross­language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different lan­guages, 
has of late become one of the major topics within the information retrieval community.
This paper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR system, where we combine a query translation
and retrieval modules. We currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore
the performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation of techni­cal 
terms. However, the technical term translation is still problematic in that technical terms
are often compound words, and thus new terms are progressively created by combining existing
base words. In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it di#cult to achieve su#cient coverage. To counter the
first problem, we produce a Japanese/English dictionary for base words, and translate compound
words on a word­by­word basis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambigu­ity. 
For the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words unlisted
in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the target language. We evaluate
our system using a test collection for CLIR, and show that both the compound word translation
and transliteration methods improve the system performance.

Abstract. This paper is an attempt at providing a fuzzy set-based formalization
of case-based reasoning. The proposed approach, which does
not take into account the learning aspects of case-based reasoning, assumes 
a principle stating that the more similar are the problem description 
attributes, the more similar are the outcome attributes . A
weaker form of this principle is also considered. These two forms of the
case-based reasoning principle are modelled in terms of fuzzy rules. Then
an approximate reasoning machinery taking advantage of this principle
enables us to apply the information stored in the memory of precedent
cases to the current problem. A particular instance of case-based reasoning, 
named case-based decision, is especially investigated. A logical
model of case-based inference is also described.

Abstract
An increasing number of countries and companies rou­tinely 
block or monitor access to parts of the Internet.
To counteract these measures, we propose Infranet, a sys­tem 
that enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive
content via cooperating Web servers distributed across the
global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access 
to censored sites while continuing to host normal un­censored 
content. Infranet uses a tunnel protocol that pro­vides 
a covert communication channel between its clients
and servers, modulated over standard HTTP transactions
that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In the upstream
direction, Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet
servers by associating meaning to the sequence of HTTP
requests being made. In the downstream direction, Infranet
servers return content by hiding censored data in uncen­sored 
images using steganographic techniques. We describe
the design, a prototype implementation, security properties,
and performance of Infranet. Our security analysis shows
that Infranet can successfully circumvent several sophisti­cated 
censoring techniques.

Abstract. The growing complexity of todays electronic designs requires reusing 
existing design components, called Intellectual Properties (IPs). Experience
management approaches can be used to support design reuse, particularly the
process of selecting reusable IPs. For the IP selection, quality criteria concerning 
the IP code and the documentation must be considered in addition to functional 
requirements of the IP. We analyse IP quality criteria in detail and show
different concepts for their integration into the retrieval process.

Abstract. In this paper, we present three techniques for knowledge discovery in
case-based reasoning. The first two techniques D-HS and D-HS+SR are
concerned with the discovery of similarity knowledge and operate on an
uncompacted case-base while the third technique D-HS+PSR is concerned with
the discovery of both similarity and case knowledge and operates on a
compacted case-base. All three techniques provide a very efficient and
competent means of similarity determination in CBR, which are empirically
shown to be up to 25 times faster than k-NN without any loss in competency.
D-HS+PSR proposes a novel approach to automatically engineering compact
case-bases with a minimal overhead to the system, compared to other
approaches such as case deletion/addition. Additionally as the approach
provides a means for automatically reducing the number of cases required in the
case-base without any loss in problem solving competency it has the greatest
implication of the three techniques for reducing the effects of the utility
problem in CBR.

Abstract. A distance on the problem domain allows one to tackle some
typical goals of machine learning, e.g. classification or conceptual clustering, 
via robust data analysis algorithms (e.g. k-nearest neighbors or
k-means) .
A method for building a distance on first-order logic domains is presented
in this paper. The distance is constructed from examples expressed as
definite or constrained clauses, via a two-step process: a set of d hypotheses 
is first learnt from the training examples. These hypotheses serve as
new descriptors of the problem domain 4: they induce a mapping pi from
4 onto the space of integers Nd The distance between any two examples 
E and F is finally defined as the Euclidean distance between pi(E)
and pi(F). The granularity of this hypothesis-driven distance (HDD) is
controlled via the user-supplied parameter d.
The relevance of a HDD is evaluated from the predictive accuracy of the
k-NN classifier based on this distance. Preliminary experiments demonstrate 
the potentialities of distance induction, in terms of predictive accuracy, 
computational cost, and tolerance to noise.

ABSTRACT 
This paper presents an object oriented layered software architecture for describing
and designing environmental (everyday) sounds in user interfaces based on a new sound model
(audio framework). This new architecture is defined by different layers including the physical
layer, system sound software layer, sound analyser/synthesiser layer and the interface layer. The
sound model described can be used as the basic design of environmental sounds in user
interfaces. This paper describes the different components: physical modelling, interaction,
context sensitivity, and metaphorical description. In the paper the term audio framework is
ultimately used for the sound model presented. This paper first provides an overview of existing
approaches for modelling environmental sounds, then presents the new audio framework, a
comparison between real and model generated sounds and finally discusses potential
applications.

"Breaking the O(n 1=(2k 1)
) Barrier for
Information­Theoretic Private Information Retrieval 

Amos Beimel y Yuval Ishai z Eyal Kushilevitz x Jean­Francois Raymond {

Abstract
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a
user to retrieve a data item from a database while hid­ing 
the identity of the item being retrieved. Specifically, in
information­theoretic, k­server PIR protocols the database
is replicated among k servers, and each server learns noth­ing 
about the item the user retrieves. The cost of such
protocols is measured by the communication complexity
of retrieving one out of n bits of data. For any fixed k,
the complexity of the best protocols prior to our work was
O(n 1
2k 1 ) (Ambainis, 1997). Since then several methods
were developed in an attempt to beat this bound, but all
these methods yielded the same asymptotic bound.
In this work, this barrier is finally broken and the com­plexity 
of information­theoretic k­server PIR is improved to
n O( log log k
k log k ) . The new PIR protocols can also be used to
construct k­query binary locally decodable codes of length
exp(n O( log log k
k log k
) ), compared to exp(n
1
k 1 ) in previous con­structions. 
The improvements presented in this paper apply
even for small values of k: the PIR protocols are more ef­ficient 
than previous ones for every k  3, and the locally
decodable codes are shorter for every k  4.

{stahl , bergmann}@informatik.uni-ki.de




Abstract. When applying CBR for Electronic Commerce. the adaptation 
capabilities of CBR can be used for product customization. Most
adaptation techniques suffer from the problem that they require a large
knowledge acquisition effort which leads to problems in the rapidly changing 
U-Commerce scenario. In this paper we present a new approach to
adaptation that is particularly suited to Electronic Commerce applications. 
It assumes that products can be structured hierarchically into
sub-components. Adaptation is achieved by incrementally replacing unsuitable 
sub-components through recursively applying CI3R to find best-matching 
alternative sub-components. The presented approach avoids
huge portions of the knowledge acquisition effort and is prototypically
implemented as an extension of the CBR-Works tool.

Abstract
This work develops a novel approach to hide the senders and the receivers of messages. 
The intuition is taken from an everyday activity that hides the \communication
pattern"" { the public transportation system. To describe our protocols, busses are
used as a metaphor: Busses, i.e., messages, are traveling on the network, each piece of
information is allocated a seat within the bus. Routes are chosen and buses are scheduled 
to traverse these routes. Deterministic and randomized protocols are presented,
the protocols differ in the number of buses in the system, the worst case traveling time,
and the required buffer size in a \station."" In particular, a protocol that is based on
cluster partition of the network is presented; in this protocol there is one bus traversing
each cluster. The clusters' size in the partition gives time and communication trade-off
s. One advantage of our protocols over previous works is that they are not based on
statistical properties for the communication pattern. Another advantage is that they
only require the processors in the communication network to be busy periodically.

Abstract. This paper presents an approach to realize a case retrieval
engine on top of a relational database. In a nutsheli the core idea is to
approximate a similarity-based retrieval with SQL-queries. The approach
avoids duplicating the case data or compiling index structures and is
therefore ideal for huge case bases which are often subject to changes. The
presented approach is fully implemented as part of the commercial CBR
toolbox orenge and the experimental evaluation demonstrates impressive
retrieval behaviour.

Abstract
Information extraction systems usually require two
dictionaries: a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of ex­traction 
patterns for the domain. We present a multi­
level bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the
semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultane­ously. 
As input, our technique requires only unan­
notated training texts and a handful of seed words
for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping tech­nique 
to alternately select the best extraction pattern
for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the
semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the
next extraction pattern. To make this approach more
robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (meta­
bootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon 
entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and
then restarts the process. We evaluated this multi­level 
bootstrapping technique on a collection of corpo­
rate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles.
The algorithm produced high­quality dictionaries for
several semantic categories.

Abstract. The paper reports a pilot study aiming at inducing rules for
disambiguating words with different possible part of speech readings in
unrestricted Swedish text. The rules, which are inspired by Constraint
Grammar, are learnt using the Progol inductive logic programming system. 
The training data is sampled from the part of speech tagged one
million word Stockholm-Umeå Corpus. The results show that the induction 
of disambiguation rules using Progol is a realistic way of learning
rules of good quality with a minimum of manual effort. When tested on
unseen data, 97% of the words retain the correct reading after tagging
leaving an ambiguity of 1.15 readings per word.

"The Adaptation Knowledge Bottleneck: How to Ease it by Learning from Cases

E-mail: kathleen.hanney, mark.keane@cs.tcd.ie


Abstract. Assuming that adaptation knowledge will continue to be an
important part of CBR systems, a major challenge for the area is to
overcome the knowledge-engineering problems that arise in its acquisition. 
This paper describes an approach to automating the acquisition
of adaptation knowledge overcoming many of the associated knowledge-engineering 
costs. This approach makes use of inductive techniques, which
learn adaptation knowledge from case comparison. We also show how this
adaptation knowledge can be usefully applied and report on how available 
domain knowledge might be exploited in such an adaptation-rule
learning-system.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a methodto extract descriptions of techni­cal 
terms from Web pages in order to utilize the World Wide Web as
an encyclopedia. We use linguistic patterns and HTML text structures
to extract text fragments contain­ing term descriptions. We also use
a language model to discard extra­neous descriptions, and a clustering

ABSTRACT
We present a multimodal interactive data exploration tool that facilitates
discrimination between visible speech tokens. The multimodal
tool uses visualization and sonification (non-speechsound)       
of data. Visible speech tokens is a class of multidimensional data 
that have been used extensively in designing talking head that has   
been used in training of deaf individuals by watching speech.    
Visible speech tokens (consonants), referred to as categories, differ 
along a set of pre-measured feature dimensions such as mouth     
height, mouth narrowing, jaw rotation and upper-lip retraction.                                                          
The data set was visualized with a series of 1D scatter-plots 
differed in color for each category. Sonification was performed 
by mapping three qualities of the data (within-category variability, 
between category variability, and category identity) to 
sound parameters (noise amplitude, duration, and pitch). An experiment
was conducted to assess the utility of multimodal in formation
compared to visual information alone for exploring this   
multidimensional data set. Tasks involved answering a series of                                                            
questions to determine how well each feature or a set of features                                                            
discriminate among categories, which categories are discriminated    
and how many. Performance was assessed by measuring accuracy                                                                 
andre action time to 36 questions varying in scale of understanding
and level of dimension integrality. Scale variedat three levels 
(ratio, ordinal, and nominal) and integrality also varied at 
levels (1, 2 , and 3 dimensions). A between-subjects design was     
used by assigning subjects to either the multimodal group or visual
only group. Results show that accuracy is better for the multimodal
group as the number of dimensions required to answer a        
question(integrality) increased. Also, accuracy was 10% better  
for the multimodal group for ordinal questions. For discriminating    
visible speech tokens, sonification provides useful information in 
addition to that given by visualization, particularly for representing 
three dimensions simultaneously.

Abstract. Numerous measures are used for performance evaluation in
machine learning. In predictive knowledge discovery, the most frequently
used measure is classification accuracy. With new tasks being addressed
in knowledge discovery, new measures appear. In descriptive knowledge
discovery, where induced rules are not primarily intended for classification, 
new measures used are novelty in clausal and subgroup discovery,
and support and confidence in association rule learning. Additional measures 
are needed as many descriptive knowledge discovery tasks involve
the induction of a large set of redundant rules and the problem is the
ranking and filtering of the induced rule set. In this paper we develop
a unifying view on some of the existing measures for predictive and descriptive 
induction. We provide a common terminology and notation by
means of contingency tables. We demonstrate how to trade off these
measures, by using what we call weighted relative accuracy. The paper
furthermore demonstrates that many rule evaluation measures developed
for predictive knowledge discovery can be adapted to descriptive knowledge 
discovery tasks.

Abstract. This work presents PRace, a knowledgebased system developed 
for the Motorsports Department of Pirelli Tyres. The system
supports the formulation of rubber compounds of tyre tread, in order to
take part (and win) in motor racing. Multiple knowledge representations
have been adopted and integrated into a single CaseBased Reasoning
(CBR) computational framework in order to capture the different competence 
involved in the decision making process. Moreover, a dedicated
representation formalism called Abstract Compounds Machine (ACM)
has been introduced in order to represent, compute, and integrate in the
CBR architecture the core knowledge regarding rubber compounds. The
result is a general case-based architecture where the adaptation step is
demanded to a component based on the ACM model.

"Learning Boxes in High Dimension 

Amos Beimel y Eyal Kushilevitz z
April 21, 1998

Abstract
We present exact learning algorithms that learn several classes of (discrete)
boxes in f0; : : : ; ` \Gamma 1g n . In particular we learn: (1) The class of unions of
O(log n) boxes in time poly(n; log `) (solving an open problem of [16, 12]; in [3]
this class is shown to be learnable in time poly(n; `)). (2) The class of unions of
disjoint boxes in time poly(n; t; log `), where t is the number of boxes. (Previ­ously 
this was known only in the case where all boxes are disjoint in one of the
dimensions; in [3] this class is shown to be learnable in time poly(n; t; `)). In
particular our algorithm learns the class of decision trees over n variables, that
take values in f0; : : : ; ` \Gamma 1g, with comparison nodes in time poly(n; t; log `),
where t is the number of leaves (this was an open problem in [9] which was
shown in [4] to be learnable in time poly(n; t; `)). (3) The class of unions of
O(1)­degenerate boxes (that is, boxes that depend only on O(1) variables) in
time poly(n; t; log `) (generalizing the learnability of O(1)­DNF and of boxes in
O(1) dimensions). The algorithm for this class uses only equivalence queries
and it can also be used to learn the class of unions of O(1) boxes (from equiv­alence 
queries only).

"A Folder­Based Graphical Interface for an Information Retrieval System

Aidan Low
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

Abstract
Past advances in user interface design include the move from an application­centric
model to the document­centric model found in the file/folder graphical interfaces of
modern operating systems. Recently, we have also seen advances in query­based
information retrieval technology, such as the search engines of the World­Wide Web.
This thesis proposes an interface that combines the power of these two technologies to
produce a unified interface that allows users to navigate their information space more
easily and more intuitively. This interface, the Haystack Browser, presents users with a
file/folder graphical interface that allows users to dynamically categorize their
information space by creating ""folders"" that correspond to queries within an information
retrieval system. The interface is implemented as an extension of the Haystack Project, a
personalized information retrieval system under development at the MIT Laboratory for
Computer Science.

"Data Mining via ILP: The Application of Progol to a Database of Enantioseparations

Christopher H.Bryant1

School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Huddersfield, HD1 3DH, UK. **


Abstract. As far as this author is aware, this is the first paper to describe 
the application of Progol to enantioseparations. A scheme is proposed 
for data mining a relational database of published enantio separations 
using Progol. The application of the scheme is described and a
preliminary assessment of the usefulness of the resulting generalisations
is made using their accuracy, size, ease of interpretation and chemical
justification.

"An Underlying Memory Model to Support Case Retrieval

Abstract. The goal of the work described in this paper is to provide
a general and underlying model of memory to support the process of
Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The approach taken is to build a range
of biasing constraint into the structure of memory itself and to use a
suitably designed activation passing process to exploit this information
as a guide for the retrieval of appropriate source cases. This provides the
potential for highly flexible case retrieval without the need for exhaustive
search of memory. This claim is supported by initial experimentation
using a prototype implementation of the memory model.

Abstract
In this paper, we further characterize the complexity of noise­tolerant learning in the PAC
model. Specifically, we show a general lower bound
of# # log(1/#)
#(1-2#) 2 # on the number of examples
required for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise. Combined with a result of
Simon, we e#ectively show that the sample complexity of PAC learning in the presence of
classification noise
is# # VC(F)
#(1-2#) 2 + log(1/#)
#(1-2#) 2 # . Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of the
general lower bound by providing a noise­tolerant learning algorithm for the class of symmetric
Boolean functions which uses a sample size within a constant factor of this bound. Finally, we
note that our general lower bound compares favorably with various general upper bounds for
PAC learning in the presence of classification noise.

Abstract. Design is a complex open-ended task and it is unreasonable to expect a
case-base to contain representatives of all possible designs. Therefore, adaptation
is a desirable capability for case-based design systems, but acquiring adaptation
knowledge can involve significant effort. In this paper adaptation knowledge is
induced separately for different criteria associated with the retrieved solution, using 
knowledge sources implicit in the case-base. This provides a committee of
learners and their combined advice is better able to satisfy design constraints and
compatibility requirements compared to a single learner. The main emphasis of the
paper is to evaluate the impact of specific-to-general and general-to-specific learning 
on adaptation knowledge acquired by committee members. For this purpose
we conduct experiments on a real tablet formulation problem which is tackled as
a decomposable design task. Evaluation results suggest that adaptation achieves
significant gains compared to a retrieve-only CBR system, but shows that both
learning biases can be beneficial for different decomposed sub-tasks.

Abstract. In this paper, we look at case retrieval systems for product 
selection. Such systems are interactive. This places demands on the
technology: customers must be able to specify their requirements in ways
that are meaningful to them; and, the cases that are retrieved must be
comprehensible in terms of the customer requirements. To meet these
demands, we introduce to case retrieval the notions of similarity metrics
with partially-ordered return types and of relations that express indifference 
between degrees of similarity.

Department of Computer Science, University of Skövde,
P0 Box 408, SE541 28 Skövde, Sweden
goran.falkman@ida.his.se



Abstract. We present an information visualisation tool, The Cube, as
a solution to the problem of visualising cases derived from large amounts
of clinical data. The Cube is based on the idea of dynamic 3D parallel diagrams, 
an idea similar to the notion of 3D parallel coordinate plots. The
Cube was developed to provide interactive visualisation of the case base
in terms of relationships between and within cases, in order to enhance
the clinicians ability to intelligibly analyse existing patient material and
to allow for pattern recognition and statistical analysis.
The design and use of The Cube are presented and discussed. We show
how the declarative model used and the tight coupling between different
visualisation tools directly led to a similarity assessment-based solution
to the problem of finding a proper arrangement of dimensions in 3D
parallel coordinate displays. The declarative, user-centered nature of The
Cube makes it suitable for interactive case-based reasoning (CBR) and
opens up for the possibility of case-based visualisation for CBR.

Abstract. This paper reports preliminary work on developing methods automatically 
to index cases described in text so that a case-based reasoning system
can reason with them. We are employing machine learning algorithms to classify
full-text legal opinions in terms of a set of predefined concepts. These factors,
representing factual strengths and weaknesses in the case, are used in the case-based 
argumentation module of our instructional environment CA TO. We first
show empirical evidence for the conncetion between the factor model and the
vector representation of texts developed in information retrieval. In a set of hypotheses 
we sketch how including knowledge about the meaning of the factors,
their relations and their use in the case-based reasoning system can improve
learning, and discuss in what ways background knowledge about the domain can
be beneficial. The paper presents initial experiments that show the limitations of
purely inductive algorithms for the task.

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to the integration 
of Case-Based Reasoning with Model-Based Reasoning in diagnostic 
problem solving. Such an integration is exploited by defining
adaptation criteria on solutions retrieved by a case-based reasoner, in
order to focus the model-based reasoner in the search for the solution
of the current case and avoiding, as much as possible, the computation
of the solution from scratch. Such adaptation criteria strictly rely on a
formal theory of diagnosis that allows us to define different adaptation
levels, relative to the trade-off between accuracy of the solution and
computational effort. A simple example in the domain of car engine
faults is presented and some important aspects are finally pointed out
on the basis of our preliminary experiments.

Abstract                                     
We present an operating system facility for efficiently transferring very large      
volumes of data between multiple processes and I/O devices, benefitting I/O intensive 
applications such as multimedia (e.g. video and image) and scientific computing. 
The execution of these programs often create an I/O pipeline, a set of
processes that repeatedly carry out the following steps: a large data block (on the      
order of Mbytes) is input from a device, is transferred between and possibly modified 
by the processes, and eventually is output to a device. Each transfer may            
require a protection domain crossing, often with significant cost in CPU time,            
memory bandwidth and space, and bus bandwidth. Our container shippinginterdomain 
transfer facility involves no physical copying between domains, and only          
incurs cost proportional to the amount of data actually accessed, which is often a       
small fraction of the amount of data transferred, leading to increased throughput        
and reduced delay.

Abstract
As more online databases are integrated into digital li­braries, 
the issue of quality control of the data becomes in­
creasingly important, especially as it relates to the effective
retrieval of information. The need to discover and reconcile
variant forms of strings in bibliographic entries, i.e., author­
ity work, will become more critical in the future. Spelling
variants, misspellings, and transliteration differences will all
increase the difficulty of retrieving information. Approxi­mate 
string matching has traditionally been used to help
with this problem. In this paper we introduce the notion of
approximate word matching and show how it can be used
to improve detection and categorization of variant forms.

Abstract. This paper presents two applications for the breast cancer
treatment decision helping. The first one is called CASIMIR/RBR and can
be likened to a rule-based reasoning system. In some situations, the application 
of the rules of this system does not provide a satisfying treatment.
Then, the application CASIMIR/CBRwhich is not fully implemented-can be used. 
CASIMIR/CBR uses principles of case-based reasoning in order 
to suggest solutions by adapting the rules of CASIMIR/RBR. In this
framework, the rules are considered as cases: they are adapted rather
than used literally.

ABSTRACT
This paper will describe the approach of modeling and sonifying   
the interaction with a pen on surfaces. The main acoustic parts   
and the dynamic behavior of the interaction are identified and a       
synthesis model is proposed to imitate the sound emanation        
during typical interactions on surfaces. Ahouglth a surace ifs
dimensional, modeling acoustical qualities of surfaces has to          
employ volumes to form resonances. Specific qualities of surfaces 
like the roughness and the texture are imitated by a noise        
generator which is controlled by the pen movement in real-time         
to achieve a maximum of acceptance of thound ee s  ffect. The     
effect will be used one hand to produce natural and coherent      
interaction on nearly silent electronic white boards or pen-tablets,   
i.e., reinventing of lost sound qualities. On the other hand      
modeling and sonifying pen strokes on surfaces allow to convey    
information about the properties of different areas or the current     
state of a windows of a computer display by using this sound      
feedback.

Abstract
The Haystack project seeks to design and implement a distributed, intelligent, per­sonalized, 
information retrieval system. Haystack archives documents with meta­
data, which is also indexed by the system to improve query results. To support
this system, an infrastructure needed to be designed and implemented. This thesis
covers the overall design of that infrastructure with a focus on the service model,
event model, remote communications model, and necessary services for the addition
of our core metadata for documents in the system.

Abstract. In this paper we will discuss the role of case-based reasoning and
learning as a tool for integrating different methods of inference and different
methods of learning. The Massive Memory Architecture, an experimental
framework for experience-based learning and reasoning, is described. Its
reflective capabilities are described and we put forth the hypothesis that learning
methods are inference methods able to inspect the problem solving process and
modify the system itself so as to improve its behavior. Therefore, learning
methods require a self-model of the system. Self-models and method
implementation are based on conceptual, knowledge-level descriptions of
inference.

Abstract. Software systems are becoming increasingly complex, demanding
for more computational resources and better software development methodologies. 
The software engineer and the CASE tool must work like a team. For this
to happen, the CASE tool must be able to understand the user, and to provide
new functionalities, such as flexible retrieval of old designs. We think that
Case-Based Reasoning can provide a reasoning framework capable of meeting
these demands. One important task that a CASE tool based on Case-Based Reasoning 
can perform adequately, is the retrieval of relevant designs. These designs 
can be stored in a case library, central to the software development company, 
thus enabling knowledge sharing through out the company. In this paper
we present an approach to case-based retrieval of software designs, and experimental 
results achieved with this approach.

Abstract
Given the growing number of patents filed in multiple countries, users are interested in retrieving patents across languages.
We propose a multi­lingual patent retrieval system, which translates a user query into the target language, searches a
multilingual database for patents relevant to the query, and improves the browsing efficiency by way of machine translation
and clustering. Our system also extracts new translations from patent families consisting of comparable patents, to enhance
the translation dictionary.

Abstract. This paper shows that the use of adaptation knowledge in
CBR systems is heavily dependent on certain task and system constraints. 
Furthermore, the type of adaptation knowledge used in systems
performing specific tasks is quite regular and predictable. These conclusions 
are reached by reviewing forty-two CBR systems and classifying
them according to three taxonomies: an adaptation-relevant taxonomy
of CBR systems, a taxonomy of tasks and a taxonomy of adaptation
knowledge. We then show how different systems cluster with respect to
interactions between these three taxonomies. The CBR system designer
may find the partition of CBR systems and the division of adaptation
knowledge suggested by this paper useful. Moreover, this paper may
help focus the initial stages of systems development by suggesting (on
the basis of existing work) what types of adaptation knowledge should be
supported by a new system. In addition, the paper provides a framework
for the preliminary evaluation and comparision of systems.

Abstract
We have developed a rule-based system, Quarc,
that can read a short story and nd the sentence
in the story that best answers a given question.
Quarc uses heuristic rules that look for lexical
and semantic clues in the question and the story.
We have tested Quarc on reading comprehension 
tests typically given to children in grades
3-6. Overall, Quarc found the correct sentence
40% of the time, which is encouraging given the
simplicity of its rules.

Abstract. A delivery robot navigating in the real world and contending
with multiple goals and priorities benefits from combining deliberative
and reactive planning. Deliberative planners anticipate and optimize actions, 
and manage multiple goals at once. Reactive planners respond flexibly 
and moment-to-moment to a changing world, based on incomplete
and flawed knowledge. This project proposes using case-based reasoning 
to fully integrate high-level and low-level planning techniques, along
with other reasoning tasks of the system. The resulting robot allows
case selection to mediate between methods. In addition, the robot learns
by recording new reactive behaviors, storing new plans it creates, and
introspective learning of retrieval features.

"An Empirical Study of Automated Dictionary Construction for Information Extraction in Three Domains

Ellen Riloff
Department of Computer Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112

A primary goal of natural language processing researchers is to de­
velop a knowledge­based natural language processing (NLP) system
that is portable across domains. However, most knowledge-­based
NLP systems rely on a domain­specific dictionary of concepts,
which represents a substantial knowledge­engineering bottleneck.
We have developed a system called AutoSlog that addresses the
knowledge­engineering bottleneck for a task called information ex­traction. 
AutoSlog automatically creates domain­specific dictionar­
ies for information extraction, given an appropriate training corpus.
We have used AutoSlog to create a dictionary of extraction patterns
for terrorism, which achieved 98% of the performance of a hand­
crafted dictionary that required approximately 1500 person­hours
to build. In this paper, we describe experiments with AutoSlog in
two additional domains: joint ventures and microelectronics. We
compare the performance of AutoSlog across the three domains,
discuss the lessons learned about the generality of this approach,
and present results from two experiments which demonstrate that
novice users can generate effective dictionaries using AutoSlog.

Abstract
In our previous study, we successfully built an
automatic mining system for parallel texts from the
Web -- PTMiner that is able to determine a large
number of parallel Web pages for different language
pairs. However, there are a number of non­parallel
text pairs in this corpus. This paper proposes a
filtering approach to clean up the corpus. Our
experiments show that once the corpus is cleaned,
both the translation accuracy of the resulting
translation models and the effectiveness of cross­
language information retrieval (CLIR) using these
models are improved significantly.

Abstract
A set of user evaluation studies were performed to test
hypotheses about the efficacy and value of the use of sonification
by itself and together with visualization to improve
the process of interactive data exploration. Our results
show that, in some cases, sonification yielded more accurate
analysis results, and when combined with visualization,
yield much better results than either one (visualization
or sonification) yielded separately. That supports sonification
as a valuable and promising tool that should be further
studied as a complement to visualization systems.

Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has been applied to discover 
rules governing the three-dimensional topology of protein structure.
The data-set unifies two sources of information; SCOP and PROMOTIF.
Cross-validation results for experiments using two background knowledge 
sets, global (attribute-valued) and constitutional (relational), are
presented. The application makes use of a new feature of Progol4.4 for
numeric parameter estimation. At this early stage of development, the
rules produced can only be applied to proteins for which the secondary
structure is known. However, since the rules are insightful, they should
prove to be helpful in assisting the development of taxonomic schemes.
The application of ILP to fold recognition represents a novel and promising 
approach to this problem.

Abstract
We derive general bounds on the complexity of
learning in the Statistical Query model and in the
PAC model with classification noise. We do so by
considering the problem of boosting the accuracy of
weak learning algorithms which fall within the Statis­tical 
Query model. This new model was introduced
by Kearns [12] to provide a general framework for ef­ficient 
PAC learning in the presence of classification
noise.
We first show a general scheme for boosting the ac­curacy 
of weak SQ learning algorithms, proving that
weak SQ learning is equivalent to strong SQ learn­
ing. The boosting is eficient and is used to show
our main result of the first general upper bounds
on the complexity of strong SQ learning. Specifi­cally, 
we derive simultaneous upper bounds with re­
spect to # on the number of queries, O(log 2 1
#
), the
Vapnik­Chervonenkis dimension of the query space,
O(log 1
#
log log 1
#
), and the inverse of the minimum tol­
erance, O( 1
#
log 1
#
). In addition, we show that these
general upper bounds are nearly optimal by describing
a class of learning problems for which we simultane­ously 
lower bound the number of queries
by#251 1
#
)
and the inverse of the minimum tolerance by # 1
#
).
We further apply our boosting results in the SQ
model to learning in the PAC model with classification
noise. Since nearly all PAC learning algorithms can be
cast in the SQ model, we can apply our boosting tech­niques 
to convert these PAC algorithms into highly
eficient SQ algorithms. By simulating these eficient
SQ algorithms in the PAC model with classification
noise, we show that nearly all PAC algorithms can be
converted into highly eficient PAC algorithms which
tolerate classification noise. We give an upper bound
on the sample complexity of these noise­tolerant PAC
algorithms which is nearly optimal with respect to the
noise rate. We also give upper bounds on space com­plexity 
and hypothesis size and show that these two
measures are in fact independent of the noise rate.
We note that the running times of these noise­tolerant
PAC algorithms are eficient.
This sequence of simulations also demonstrates that
it is possible to boost the accuracy of nearly all PAC
algorithms even in the presence of noise. This provides
a partial answer to an open problem of Schapire [15]
and the first theoretical evidence for an empirical re­sult 
of Drucker, Schapire and Simard [4].

"ADAPtER: An Integrated Diagnostic System Combining Case-Based and Abductive Reasoning

Luigi Portinale, Pietro Torasso

Dipartimento di Informatica - Universita di Torino (Italy)


Abstract. The aim of this paper is to describe the ADAPtER system, a
diagnostic architecture combining case-based reasoning with abductive reasoning 
and exploiting the adaptation of the solution of old episodes, in order
to focus the reasoning process. Domain knowledge is represented via a logical
model and basic mechanisms, based on abductive reasoning with consistency
constraints, have been defined for solving complex diagnostic problems involving 
multiple faults. The model-based component has been supplemented
with a case memory and adaptation mechanisms have been developed, in
order to make the diagnostic system able to exploit past experience in solving 
new cases. A heuristic function is proposed, able to rank the solutions
associated to retrieved cases with respect to the adaptation effort needed
to transform such solutions into possible solutions for the current case. We
will discuss some preliminary experiments showing the validity of the above
heuristic and the convenience of solving a new case by adapting a retrieved
solution rather than solving the new problem from scratch.

Abstract. In this paper we describe a domain independent architecture
to help in the design of knowledge intensive CBR systems. It is based on
the knowledge incorporation from a library of application-independent
ontologies and the use of an ontology with the common CBR terminology
that guides the case representation and allows the description of flexible,
generic and homogeneous CBR processes based on classification.

Abstract We describe a testbed for database selection
techniques and an experiment conducted using this testbed.
The testbed is a decomposition of the TREC/TIPSTER
data that allows analysis of the data along multiple dimen­sions, 
including collection­based and temporal­based anal­ysis. 
We characterize the subcollections in this testbed in
terms of number of documents, queries against which the
documents have been evaluated for relevance, and distribu­tion 
of relevant documents. We then present initial results
from a study conducted using this testbed that examines
the effectiveness of the gGlOSS approach to database selection. 
The databases from our testbed were ranked us­ing 
the gGlOSS techniques and compared to the gGlOSS
Ideal(l) baseline and a baseline derived from TREC rele­vance 
judgements. We have examined the degree to which
several gGlOSS estimate functions approximate these base­lines. 
Our initial results confirm that the gGlOSS estima­tors 
are excellent predictors of the Ideal(l) ranks but that
the Ideal(l) ranks do not estimate relevance­based ranks
well.

Abstract. A system for tagging words with their part-of-speech (POS)
tags is constructed. The system has two components: a lexicon containing 
the set of possible POS tags for a given word, and rules which use
a words context to eliminate possible tags for a word. The Inductive
Logic Programming (ILP) system Progol is used to induce these rules
in the form of definite clauses. The final theory contained 885 clauses.
For background knowledge, Progol uses a simple grammar, where the
tags are terminals and predicates such as nounp (noun phrase) are non-terminais. 
Progol was altered to allow the caching of information about
clauses generated during the induction process which greatly increased
efficiency. The system achieved a per-word accuracy of 96.4% on known
words drawn from sentences without quotation marks. This is on a par
with other tagging systems induced from the same data [5, 2, 4] which
all have accuracies in the range 9697%. The per-sentence accuracy was
49.5%.

Abstract. CASA (computer aided systems architecting) is a methodology and
tool to support the design of complex technical systems. It combines approaches
from systems and requirement engineering and AI. System design in CASA is
requirement-driven and works by a hierarchical stepwise top-down refinement
of designs and a hierarchical decision making process. One important task in
CASA deals with reusability of existing design artifacts and is supported by
case-based reasoning techniques. Based on given structural specifications and
formal requirements, a search procedure finds the best inexact match in a design
base and computes an estimated degree of fulfillment for requirements. The approach 
employs efficient graph matching and indexing scheme for case retrieval
and structural similarities and has adapted usual similarity measures to compute
degree of fulfillment of requirements. It has been show by different example
projects that the developed methods can be of great practical assistance for a designer.

ABSTRACT
When a digital library is decomposed into many geographi­cally 
distributed repositories, search efficiency becomes an is­sue. 
Increasing network congestion makes this a compelling
issue. We discuss an effective method for reducing the num­ber 
of servers needed to respond to a query and give examples
of search space reduction in the NCSTRL distributed digital
library.

"Using Mobile Agents for Analyzing Intrusion in Computer Networks #

Department of Computer Science, Institute for Security Technology Studies

Hanover, NH 03755

Today hackers disguise their attacks by launching
them form a set of compromised hosts distributed
across the Internet. It is very dificult to defend
against these attacks or to track down their origin.
Commercially available intrusion detection systems
can signal the occurrence of limited known types of at­
tacks. New types of attacks are launched regularly but
these tools are not effective in detecting them. Human
experts are still the key tool for identifying, tracking,
and disabling new attacks. Often this involves experts
from many organizations working together to share
their observations, hypothesis, and attack signatures.
Unfortunately, today these experts have few tools that
help them to automate this process.
In this project we recognize that human experts
will remain a critical part in the process of identi­fying, 
tracking and disabling computer attacks. We
also recognize that an important part of the discov­ery, 
analysis, and defense against new distributed at­
tacks is the cooperation that occurs between experts
across different organizations. Many installations do
not have the expertise necessary to develop full attack
analyses. Our goal is to build automated tools for
computer experts and system administrators to:
. identify the characteristics of an attack given data
from network sensors
. develop a hypothesis about the nature and origin
of the attack
. share that hypothesis with security managers
from other sites
. test that hypothesis at those other sites and co­
ordinate the results of testing
. archive the data necessary for use as evidence in
later law­enforcement actions

ABSTRACT
Much work in information retrieval focuses on using a model
of documents and queries to derive retrieval algorithms. Model
based development is a useful alternative to heuristic devel­opment 
because in a model the assumptions are explicit and
can be examined and refined independent of the particular
retrieval algorithm. We explore the explicit assumptions un­derlying 
the nave Bayesian framework by performing com­putational 
analysis of actual corpora and queries to devise a
generative document model that closely matches text. Our
thesis is that a model so developed will be more accurate
than existing models, and thus more useful in retrieval, as
well as other applications. We test this by learning from a
corpus the best document model. We find the learned model
better predicts the existence of text data and has improved
performance on certain IR tasks.

Abstract. This paper describes a tool set developed to aid a human
content analyst index texts for use in a particular form of structured
hypermedia known as an ASK System. The tool set assists the content
analyst by employing a library of question templates to represent the
types of questions the output ASK system might contain. Question
templates provided roughly a six-fold increase in the rate with which
texts are indexed compared to manual techniques. Indexing progress is
linear throughout, indicating that the methodology can be used to
effectively index a large body of texts.

"Diverse Product Recommendations Using an Expressive Language for Case Retrieval

Derek Bridge and Alex Ferguson

Department of Computer Science,
University College, Cork
d.bridge/a.ferguson@cs.ucc.ie



Abstract. We describe Order-Based Retrieval, which is an approach to
case retrieval based on the application of partial orders to the case base.
We argue that it is well-suited to product recommender applications because, 
as well as retrieving products that best match customer-specified
ideal attribute-values, it also: allows the customer to specify soft constraints; 
gives a natural semantics and implementation to tweaks; and
delivers an inherently diverse result set.

IPSI - Integrated Publication and Information Systems Institute

mueller-tomfelde@ipsi.fhg.de  



ABSTRACT
This paper will describe further research on a real-time         
convolution algorithm for long a FIR filter based on non-uniform 
bock partitioning. The static behaviour of the           
algorithm which solves the dilemma between the computational     
load and the latency of the processing operation is well         
examined in literature. New directions are investigated to       
exploit the inherent features of the algorithm and utilise them  
for audio applications. Especially a dynamic exchange of filter  
coefficients or subsets of them of a room impulse response is    
discussed and implemented. Unlike to traditional DSP             
solutions the prototype is realised in portable software objects 
and components that can be compiled on multi-propose             
processing units like off-the-shelf computers with standard 
audio facilities and different operating systems.

"Induction of Recursive Theories in the Normal ILP Setting: Issues and Solutions

Abstract. Induction of recursive theories in the normal ILP setting is a complex
task because of the non-monotonicity of the consistency property. In this paper
we propose computational solutions to some relevant issues raised by the
multiple predicate learning problem . A separate-and-parallel-conquer search
strategy is adopted to interleave the learning of clauses supplying predicates
with mutually recursive definitions. A novel generality order to be imposed to
the search space of clauses is investigated in order to cope with recursion in a
more suitable way. The consistency recovery is performed by reformulating the
current theory and by applying a layering technique based on the collapsed
dependency graph. The proposed approach has been implemented in the ILP
system ATRE and tested in the specific context of the document understanding
problem within the WISDOM project. Experimental results are discussed and
future directions are drawn.

Abstract. Locomotives, like many modem complex machines, are equipped
with the capability to generate on-board fault messages indicating the presence
of anomalous conditions. Such messages tend to generate in large quantities
and difficult and time consuming to interpret manually. This paper presents the
design and development of a case-based reasoning system for diagnosing locomotive 
faults using such fault messages as input. The process of using his-
torical repair data and expert input for case generation and validation is described. 
An algorithm for case matching is presented along with some results
on pilot data.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the Adaptive Place Advisor, a user
adaptive, conversational recommendation system designed to help users
decide on a destination, specifically a restaurant. We view the selection
of destinations as an interactive, conversational process, with the
advisory system inquiring about desired item characteristics and the
human responding. The user model, which contains preferences
regarding items, attributes, values, value combinations, and
diversification, is also acquired during the conversation. The system
enhances the users requirements with the user model and retrieves
suitable items from a case-base. If the number of items found by the
system is unsuitable (too high, too low) the next attribute to be
constrained or relaxed is selected based on the information gain
associated with the attributes. We also describe the current status of the
system and future work.

within a team work situation the DynaWall is equipped with a                                                              
set of loudspeakers which are invisibly integrated into the                                                               
environment. Different forms of audio feedback are realized and

commands. Furthermore a spatial sound property of moved and                                                               
thrown information objects on the surface of the otherwise
silent electronic whiteboard is introduced to add an imitated
natural sound behavior. The focus of the setup is to experiment
with sound feedback for a non-standard computer environment    
useful in a cooperative team work situation.

"REMEX - A Case-Based Approach for Reusing Software Measurement Experienceware

Christiane Gresse von Wangenheim

Abstract. For the improvement of software quality and productivity, organizations 
need to systematically build up and reuse software engineering know-how,
promoting organizational learning in software development. Therefore, an integrated 
support platform has to be developed for capturing, storing and retrieving
software engineering knowledge. Technical support is complicated through specific 
characteristics of the software engineering domain, such as the lack of
explicit domain models in practice and the diversity of environments. Applying
Case-Based Reasoning, we propose an approach for the representation of relevant 
software engineering experiences, the goal-oriented and similarity-based
retrieval tailorable to organization-specific characteristics and the continuous
acquisition of new experiences. The approach is applied and validated in the
context of the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) approach, an innovative technology
for software measurement.

Abstract. This paper presents a case-based tutor, CECELIA 1.1, that
is based on techniques from CELIA, a computer model of case-based apprenticeship 
learning [Redmond 1992]. The teaching techniques include:
interactive, step by step presentation of case solution steps, student predictions 
of an experts actions, presentation of the experts steps, student
explanations of the experts actions, and presentation of the experts explanation. 
In addition, GECELIA takes advantage of a technique from
VanLehns [1987] SIERRA  presenting examples in an order so that solutions 
only differ by one branch, or disjunct, from previously presented
examples. CEGELIA relies on its teaching strategy encouraging greater
processing of the examples by the student, rather than on embedding
great amounts of intelligence in the tutor. CEGELIA is implemented using 
Hypercard on an Apple Macintosh, and has been pilot tested with
real students. The tests suggest that the approach can be helpful, but
also suggest that eliciting self-explanations from students who normally
do not self-explain may be challenging.

Abstract. We present a method for discovering new knowledge from
structural data which are represented by graphs in the framework of
inductive logic programming. A graph, or network, is widely used for
representing relations between various data and expressing a small and
easily understandable hypothesis. Formal Graph System (FGS) is a kind
of logic programming system which directly deals with graphs just like
first order terms. By employing refutably inductive inference algorithms
and graph algorithmic techniques, we are developing a knowledge discovery 
system KD-FGS, which acquires knowledge directly from graph
data by using FGS as a knowledge representation language.
In this paper we develop a logical foundation of our knowledge discovery
system. A term tree is a pattern which consists of variables and tree-like 
structures. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a unifier
of a term tree and a tree in order to make consistency checks efficiently.
Moreover we give experimental results on some graph theoretical notions
with the system. The experiments show that the system is useful for
finding new knowledge.

Abstract. Speech recognition has of late become a practical technol­ogy 
for real world applications. Aiming at speech­driven text retrieval,
which facilitates retrieving information with spoken queries, we propose
a method to integrate speech recognition and retrieval methods. Since
users speak contents related to a target collection, we adapt statistical
language models used for speech recognition based on the target collec­tion, 
so as to improve both the recognition and retrieval accuracy. Ex­periments 
using existing test collections combined with dictated queries
showed the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract. We investigate how abduction and induction can be integrated 
into a common learning framework through the notion of Abductive 
Concept Learning (ACL). ACL is an extension of Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) to the case in which both the background and the
target theory are abductive logic programs and where an abductive notion 
of entailment is used as the coverage relation. In this framework, it
is then possible to learn with incomplete information about the examples
by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction.
The paper presents the basic framework of ACL with its main characteristics. 
An algorithm for an intermediate version of AOL is developed by
suitably extending the top-down ILP method and integrating this with
an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP).
A prototype system has been developed and applied to learning problems
with incomplete information.

"An Approach to Aggregating Ensembles of Lazy Learners That Supports Explanation

Gabriele Zenobi and Pádraig Cunningham

{Gabriele.Zenobi, Padraig.Cunningham}@cs.tcd.ie



Abstract: Ensemble research has shown that the aggregated output of an
ensemble of predictors can be more accurate than a single predictor. This is true
also for lazy learning systems like Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and k-Nearest-Neighbour. 
Aggregation is normally achieved by voting in classification tasks
and by averaging in regression tasks. For CBR, this increased accuracy comes
at the cost of interpretability however. If we consider the use of retrieved cases
for explanation to be one of the advantages of CBR then this is lost in an
ensemble. This is because a large number of cases will have been retrieved by
the ensemble members. In this paper we present a new technique for
aggregation that obtains excellent results and identifies a small number of cases
for use in explanation. This new approach might be viewed as a transformation
process whereby cases are transformed from their feature based representation
to a representation based on the predictions of ensemble members. This new
representation produces very accurate predictions and allows a small number of
similar neighbours to be identified.

Abstract. The ultimate goal of CBR applications is to satisfy customers using this
technology in their daily business. As one of the crucial issues in CBR for practical
applications, maintenance is important to cope with demands changing over time.
Review and restore are the two steps in CBR that deal with tasks of maintenance. In
order to perform these tasks, we suggested case and case base properties, quality
criteria, and restore operators in earlier publications. In this paper, we specify
concrete performance measures that correspond to general customer requirements,
and analyze the relations between these performance criteria, case properties,
and restore operators. We present initial results on theoretical analyzes on these
relations, and report on examples of experimental studies that indicate that the
suggested case properties and the respective restore operators help to identify
maintenance strategies in order to optimize performance of CBR systems over
time.

email: {martin,cv}@lifo.univ-orleans.fr


Abstract. We propose in this paper a new approach for learning predicate 
definitions from examples and from an initial theory. The particularity 
of this approach consists in inventing both a new predicate symbol
and a specification for this predicate at most steps of learning. The specifications 
that are built are incomplete and imprecise, what is modelized
by introducing the notion of o-interpretation. At the end of the learning
task, some invented predicates are removed by unfolding techniques. The
remaining predicates either enable to simplify the program, or are defined 
by recursive programs. In the second case, the program could not
have been learned without inventing these predicates.
The method has been implemented in a system, called SPILP, which
has been successfully tested for inventing predicates which simplify the
learned programs as well as for inventing recursively defined predicates.
Let us point out that the introduction of o-interpretations gives us a
general framework for dealing with imprecise specifications and that
SPILP can work, even when the target concepts are also incompletely
defined by o-interpretations.

"A framework for audio analysis based on classification and temporal segmentation

Abstract
Existing audio tools handle the increasing amount of computer audio data
inadequately. The typical tape­recorder paradigm for audio interfaces is
inflexible and time consuming, especially for large data sets. On the other
hand, completely automatic audio analysis and annotation is impossible
using current techniques.
Alternative solutions are semi­automatic user interfaces that let users
interact with sound in flexible ways based on content. This approach offers
significant advantages over manual browsing, annotation and retrieval. Fur­thermore, 
it can be implemented using existing techniques for audio content
analysis in restricted domains.
This paper describes a framework for experimenting, evaluating and in­
tegrating such techniques. As a test for the architecture, some recently
proposed techniques have been implemented and tested. In addition, a new
method for temporal segmentation based on audio texture is described. This
method is combined with audio analysis techniques and used for hierarchical
browsing, classification and annotation of audio files.

ABSTRACT
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large
sensor networks. We seek to optimize the lifetime of the
network. We develop an approximation algorithm called
max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive ra­tio. 
To ensure scalability, we introduce a hierarchical algo­rithm, which is called zone­based routing.

Abstract
We present a bootstrapping method that
uses strong syntactic heuristics to learn
semantic lexicons. The three sources
of information are appositives, compound
nouns, and ISA clauses. We apply heuris­
tics to these syntactic structures, embed
them in a bootstrapping architecture, and
combine them with co­training. Results
on WSJ articles and a pharmaceutical cor­pus 
show that this method obtains high
precision and finds a large number of
terms.

ABSTRACT
Much work in information retrieval has been focused on the
use of a model of documents and queries to derive retrieval
algorithms based upon that model. Models are a useful al­ternative 
to the heuristic development of retrieval algorithms
because they make explicit the assumptions of the model
developer, allowing the assumptions to be examined and re­fined 
independent of the particular retrieval algorithm. Un­fortunately, 
in many cases these models are built by intu­ition, 
and their assumptions are not carefully tested against
actual data. Thus, when a model based retrieval algorithm
fails, it is not clear whether the fault is in the algorithm or
the underlying model.
In this paper, we devise a generative document model via
analysis of actual corpora and queries. Our thesis is that a
model so developed will be more accurate, and thus more
useful in retrieval, than a heuristic model. We test this
hypothesis by learning from the corpus the best document
model within a nave Bayesian framework, and investigating
both how closely this learned model matches the data and
how well it can be used to perform retrieval.

Abstract. Reliable and effective maintenance support is a vital consideration
for the management within todays manufacturing environment. This paper discusses 
the development a maintenance system for the world largest robot
welding facility. The developed system combines a case-based reasoning approach 
for diagnosis with context information, as electronic on-line manuals,
linked using open hypermedia technology. The work discussed in this paper
delivers not only a maintenance system for the robot stations under consideration, 
but also a design framework for developing maintenance systems for other
similar applications.

{henke,asker}@dsv.su.se



Abstract. Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) and Separate-and-Conquer
(SAC) are two strategies for rule induction that have been used extensively. 
When searching for rules DAC is maximally conservative w.r.t.
decisions made during search for previous rules. This results in a very
efficient strategy, which however suffers from difficulties in effectively inducing 
disjunctive concepts due to the replication problem. SAC on the
other hand is maximally liberal in the same respect. This allows for a
larger hypothesis space to be searched, which in many cases avoids the
replication problem but at the cost of lower efficiency. We present a hybrid 
strategy called Reconsider-and-Conquer (RAC), which handles the
replication problem more effectively than DAC by reconsidering some of
the earlier decisions and allows for more efficient induction than SAC
by holding on to some of the decisions. We present experimental results
from propositional, numerical and relational domains demonstrating that
RAC significantly reduces the replication problem from which DAC suffers 
and is several times (up to an order of magnitude) faster than SAC.

Abstract. The application of algorithms for efficiently generating association 
rules is so far restricted to cases where information is put together
in a single relation. We describe how this restriction can be overcome
through the combination of the available algorithm. with standard techniques 
from the field of inductive logic programming. We present the
system WARMR, which extends APRIORI [2] to mine association rules
in multiple relations. We apply WARMR to the natural language processing 
task of mining part-of-speech tagging rules in a large corpus of
English. be applied to further constrain the space of interesting ARMRs.

Abstract
An environment for designing virtual instruments with     
3D geometry has been prototyped and applied to realtime
sound control and design. It was implemented by extending
a realtime, visual programming language called    
Max/FTS, running on an SGI Onyx, with software objects
to interface CyberGloves and Polhemus sensors and   
to compute human movement and virtual object features.    
Virtual input devices with behaviours of a rubber balloon
and sheet were designed for the control of sound     
spatialization and timbre parameters.     Informal evaluation
showed that a sonification inspired by the physical
world appears natural and effective. More research    
is required for a natural sonification of virtual input device
features such as shape, taking into account possible
co-articulation of these features. While both hands    
can be used for manipulation, left-hand-only interaction   
with a virtual instrument may be a useful replacement for  
and extension of the standard music synthesizer keyboard   
modulation wheel. More research is needed to identify      
and apply manipulation pragmatics and movement features,
and to investigate how they are co-articulated, in  
the mapping of virtual object parameters.

Abstract                                                                                  
This thesis describes the implementation and the evaluation of a graphical user             
interface (GUI) employing the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) technique.             
The GUI was implemented on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) featuring a 4.5               
inch touch-sensitive colour screen.
    The aim of the user evaluation was two-fold: firstly, to compare self-paced             
RSVP with reading on paper medium, in terms of reading speed, reading comprehension,
reading efficiency, experienced workload and readers' attitude; secondly,               
to examine whether sonification(adding audio information) of the text is a way to               
height en the reading experience when reading with RSVP .                                       
    The user evaluation was conducted with ten subjects using a repeated-measurement              
design. The texts usedweresix chaptersof August Strindberg's Roda Rummet.   
Four different conditions were administered: book, two self-paced RSVP formats,                  
and a sonified RSVP format presented at constant speed. The evaluation showed                  
no significant differences in reading speed, comprehension, or reading efficiency                 
between reading from the book and the self-paced RSVP conditions. A linear                 
speed-accuracy trade-off between comprehension and reading speed was found.                  
For each 100-word increase in reading speed comprehension decreased by 9%.                   
The subjects rated all six factors in a workload index, except Physical demand,             
significantly higher for the self-paced RSVP conditions than for paper medium.                
Regarding attitude, subjects found RSVP significantly more difficult, less 
comprehensible, and less stimulating than reading from a book.

"PROFIL : a decision support tool for metallic sections design using a CBR approach

Abstract

This paper presents the PROFIL system, a Decision Support Tool for the Design of
metallic sections production. The PROFIL system uses a Case-Based Reasoning approach
for the selection of pertinent former designs.
Production of metallic sections is done by a succession of forming operations. The design
task is composed of two parts : selection and scheduling of operations and assessment of
forming tools geometry.
The PROFIL system also provides support to production technicians, to input process
parameters and control measurements as part of cases, and to adjust settings during pre-production trials.
Selection of cases is made by following two orthogonal points of view, on similarity and
quality of produced parts. Similarity is based on selection of relevant dimensions of the
section, while quality is based on selection of potential defects. Each dimension or defect
is associated to an evaluation function which uses a fuzzy logic approach. To improve
ergonomy, relevant cases are displayed in a two-dimension space : similitude/quality.
Implementation of the system has been done on a computer workstation, using a
commercial DBMS, in order to cope with industrial requirements.
The PROFIL system is operational in the industrial site and provides support to designers
and process technicians.

"Case-Based Reasoning for Cash Flow Forecasting using Fuzzy Retrieval

	Abstract. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) simulates the human way of solving
problems as it solves a new problem using a successful past experience applied to a
similar problem. In this paper we describe a CBR system that develops forecasts
for cash flow accounts. Forecasting cash flows to a certain degree of accuracy is an
important aspect of a Working Capital Decision Support System. Working Capital
(WC) management decisions reflect a choice among different options on how to
arrange the cash flow. The decision establishes an actual event in the cash flow
which means that one needs to envision the consequences of such a decision.
Hence, forecasting cash flows accurately can minimize losses caused by usually
unpredictable events. Cash flows are usually forecasted by a combination of
different techniques enhanced by human experts feelings about the future, which
are grounded in past experience. This makes the use of the CBR paradigm the
proper choice. Advantages of a CBR system over other Artificial Intelligence
techniques are associated to knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation,
reuse, updating, and justification. An important step in developing a CBR system is
the retrieval of similar cases. The proposed system makes use of fuzzy integrals to
calculate the synthetic evaluations of similarities between cases instead of the usual
weighted mean.

"Automatically Generating Extraction Patterns from Untagged Text

Ellen Riloff
Department of Computer Science
University of Utah
Salt Lake City, UT 84112
riloff@cs.utah.edu

Many corpus­based natural language processing sys­tems 
rely on text corpora that have been manually
annotated with syntactic or semantic tags. In partic­ular, 
all previous dictionary construction systems for
information extraction have used an annotated train­ing 
corpus or some form of annotated input. We have
developed a system called AutoSlog­TS that creates
dictionaries of extraction patterns using only untagged
text. AutoSlog­TS is based on the AutoSlog system,
which generated extraction patterns using annotated
text and a set of heuristic rules. By adapting Au­toSlog 
and combining it with statistical techniques, we
eliminated its dependency on tagged text. In experi­ments 
with the MUC­4 terrorism domain, AutoSlog­
TS created a dictionary of extraction patterns that
performed comparably to a dictionary created by Au­toSlog, 
using only preclassified texts as input.

"Morse Operators for Digital Planar Surfaces and Their Application to Image Segmentation

Luis Gustavo Nonato, Antônio Castelo Filho, Rosane Minghim, and João Batista

AbstractThis paper introduces the concept of digital planar
surfaces and corresponding Morse operators. These operators
offer a novel and powerful method for construction and de-construction
of such surfaces in a way that global topological control
of the resulting object is always maintained. In that respect, this
paper offers a complete pixel characterization tool. Image handling
is a natural application for such approach.We present a novel fast
algorithm for image segmentation using Morse operators for digital
planar surfaces. It classifies as a region growing technique with
added topological control and is extremely useful for applications
that need proper object description. Results from real data are
stimulating, and show that the segmentation algorithm compares
very well with other methods. The topological approach also
forms a base for future expansion to applications such as volume
segmentation.

Abstract. The recent progress in Case- Based Reasoning has shown that one of the
most important challenges in developing future AL methods will be to combine and
synergistically utilize general and case-based knowledge. In this paper a very
rudimentary kind of integration for the classification task, based on simple
heuristics, is sketched: To solve a problem, first try to use the conventional rule-based 
approach. If it does not work, try to remember a similar problem you have
solved in the past and adapt the old solution to the new situation. This heuristic
approach is based on the knowledge base that consists of rule base and exception
case base. The method of generating this kind of knowledge base from a set of
examples is described. The proposed approach is tested, and compared with
altemative approaches. The experimental results show that the presented integration
method can lead to an improvement in accuracy and comprehensibility.

ABSTRACT
Multi­agent systems can be fully developed only
when they have access to a large number of
information sources. These latter are becoming more
and more available on the Internet in form of web
pages. This paper does not deal with the problem of
information retrieval, but rather the extraction of data
from HTML web pages in order to make them usable
by autonomous agents. This problem is not trivial
because of the heterogeneity of web pages. We
describe our approach to facilitate the formalization,
extraction and grouping of data from different
sources. To do this, we developed a utility tool that
assists us in generating a uniform description for each
information source, using a descriptive domain
ontology. Users and agents can query the extracted
data using a standard querying interface. The ultimate
goal of this tool is to provide useful information to
autonomous agents.

Abstract
In the Case-Based Reasoning paradigm cases are often
given initially in natural language in the form of a story. While this
textual form is appropriate for humans, it is often not suitable for direct
application by a computer. Our paper uses the legal domain of
sentencing for criminal offences to illustrate an approach to indexing,
knowledge representation of stories and their application in reasoning.
This approach extends the well-known concept of Explanation Patterns.

"Bayes Optimal Metasearch: A Probabilistic Model for Combining the Results of Multiple Retrieval Systems

Abstract
We introduce a new, probabilistic model for combining
the outputs of an arbitrary number of query retrieval
systems. By gathering simple statistics on the average
performance of a given set of query retrieval systems,
we construct a Bayes optimal mechanism for combining
the outputs of these systems. Our construction yields a
metasearch strategy whose empirical performance nearly
always exceeds the performance of any of the constituent
systems. Our construction is also robust in the sense that
if \good"" and \bad"" systems are combined, the performance 
of the composite is still on par with, or exceeds,
that of the best constituent system. Finally, our model
and theory provide theoretical and empirical avenues for
the improvement of this metasearch strategy.

In this paper we report on an ongoing investigation into the    
relationship between musical structure and hyperstructure, based
on a series of open hypermedia systems research projects that   
have featured case studies involving musical content. We provide
a general overview of the intersection between hypermedia and   
musical structure, drawing also on ideas from narrative structure.
Through the example systems we consider techniques for          
building hyperstructure from musical structure and, conversely, 
building musical structure from hyperstructure.  Additionally we                    
describe an experiment in the sonification of hyperstructure.

"Evaluation of Strategies for Generalised Cases within a Case-Based Reasoning Antibiotics Therapy Advice System

Abstract. For an intensive care unit, we have developed an antibiotics
therapy advice system, called ICONS. To speed-up the process of
finding suitable therapy recommendations we have applied Case-based
Reasoning techniques. As in a medical expert system all required
information should always be up-to-date, a static case base is
inappropriate. New cases should be incrementally incorporated into the
case base and outdated ones should be updated or erased. For reasons of
space limitations and of retrieval time an indefinite growth of the case
base should be avoided. To fulfil these requirements we propose to
generalise from single cases to prototypical cases and to erase redundant
cases. In this paper, we mainly focus on results of extended experiments
with generation strategies of generalised cases (prototypes).
Additionally, we compare measured retrieval times for two indexing
retrieval algorithms: For simple indexing and Tree-Hash retrieval.

"PRODIGY/ANALOGY: Analogical Reasoning in General Problem Solving*

Abstract. This paper describes the integration of analogical reasoning
into general problem solving as a method of learning at the strategy level
to solve problems more effectively. The method hased on derivational
analogy has been fully implemented in PRODIGY/ANALOGY and proven
empirically to he amenable to scaling up hoth in terms of domain and
problem complexity. PRODIGY/ANALOGY addresses a set of challenging
problems, namely: how to accumulate episodic problem solving experience, 
cases, how to define and decide when two problem solving situations
are similar, how to organize a large library of planning cases so that
it may be efficiently retrieved, and finally how to successfully transfer
chains of problem solving decisions from past experience to new problem
solving situations when only a partial match exists among corresponding
problems. The paper discusses the generation and replay of the problem
solving cases and we illustrate the algorithms with examples. We present
briefly the library organization and the retrieval strategy. We relate this
work with other alternative strategy learning methods, and also with
plan reuse. PRODIGY/ANALOGY casts the strategy-level learning process
for the first time as the automation of the complete cycle of constructing, 
storing, retrieving, and flexibly reusing problem solving experience.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analogical replay strategy by
providing empirical results on the performance of PRODIGY/ANALOGY,
accumulating and reusing a large case library in a complex problem solving 
domain. The integrated learning system reduces the problem solving
search effort incrementally as more episodic experience is compiled into
the library of accumulated learned knowledge.

Abstract. We propose to analyze CBR systems at knowledge level following the
Components of Expertise methodology. This methodology has been used for
design and construction of KBS applications. We have applied it to analyze
learning methods of existing systems at knowledge level. As example we
develop the knowledge level analysis of CHEF. Then a common task structure
of CBR systems is explained. We claim that this sort of analysis can be a first
step to integrate different learning methods into case-based reasoning systems.

This paper describes the design of user-interface widgets that include non-speech sound. Previous research has shown
that the addition of sound can improve the usability of human-computer interfaces. However, there is little research to
show where the best places are to add sound to improve usability. The approach described here is to integrate sound into
widgets, the basic components of the human-computer interface. An overall structure for the integration of sound is
presented. There are many problems with current graphical widgets and many of these are difficult to correct by using
more graphics. This paper presents many of the standard graphical widgets and describes how sound can be added. It
describes in detail the usability problems with the widgets and then the non-speech sounds to overcome them. The non-
speech sounds used are earcons. These sonically-enhanced widgets allow designers who are not sound-experts to create
interfaces that effectively improve usability and have coherent and consistent sounds.

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a study of an auditory version of the game   
Towers of Hanoi. In this study, we have compared three           
different strategies for continuous presentation of the objects.                         
The focus for this study is to investigate the nature of auditory                        
direct manipulation, where continuous presentation is one of                             
the key aspects. The results show that the differences between                           
the strategies need to be explored further by experimentation.                           
Additionally, much effort has to be put on the learning phase                            
of the auditory interface and the mouse interaction has to be                            
investigated further.

"Robust Information­Theoretic Private Information Retrieval

Amos Beimel  Yoav Stahl y

Abstract
A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a user to retrieve a data item of its choice from
a database, such that the servers storing the database do not gain information on the identity of the item
being retrieved. PIR protocols were studied in depth since the subject was introduced in Chor, Goldreich,
Kushilevitz, and Sudan 1995. The standard definition of PIR protocols raises a simple question -- what
happens if some of the servers crash during the operation? How can we devise a protocol which still works
in the presence of crashing servers? Current systems do not guarantee availability of servers at all times
for many reasons, e.g., crash of server or communication problems. Our purpose is to design robust PIR
protocols, i.e., protocols which still work correctly even if only k out of ` servers are available during the
protocols' operation (the user does not know in advance which servers are available).
We present various robust PIR protocols giving different tradeoffs between the different parameters.
These protocols are incomparable, i.e., for different values of n and k we will get better results using differ­ent 
protocols. We first present a generic transformation from regular PIR protocols to robust PIR protocols,
this transformation is important since any improvement in the communicationcomplexity of regular PIR protocol 
will immediately implicate improvement in the robust PIR protocol communication. We also present
two specific robust PIR protocols. Finally, we present robust PIR protocols which can tolerate Byzantine
servers, i.e., robust PIR protocols which still work in the presence of malicious servers or servers with
corrupted or obsolete databases.

Abstract: Distribution of the visualization process over the World-Wide Web allows remote access to
expensive resources, and the cooperation amongst teams of experts that are located in different places. This
paper presents an architecture and a corresponding prototype implementation of a distributed system for
visualization and sonification of scientific data. The distribution is accomplished by the addition of
visualization and sonification servers, accessible over the Internet, and implemented using an XML-based
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol. The system is an evolution of a previously-developed
prototype, with improvement in the visualization and in the distribution aspects of the architecture. Former
distribution scheme employed CORBA (Common Object Request Broker). A discussion on the use of both
distribution tools is given in the light of visualization tasks.

Abstract. A model for adaptation in case-based reasoning (cBR) is presented. 
Similarity assessment is based on the computation and the iterated 
estimation of structural relationships among representations, and
adaptation is given as a special case of the general process.
Compared to traditional approaches to adaptation within CBR, the presented 
model has the advantage of using a uniform declarative model for
both case representation, similarity assessment and adaptation. As a consequence, 
adaptation knowledge can be made directly available during
similarity assessment and for explanation purposes. The use of a uniform
model also provides the possibility of a CBR approach to adaptation.
The model is compared with other approaches to adaptation within CBR.

Abstract. The integration of classical case-based reasoning with other
problem solving methods attracts increasing research interest in the
broader area of information and decision support systems. This paper
presents a framework where CBR and Argumentation Based Reasoning
jointly aid agents to address various discourse instances in group decision
making processes. The ability to comprehend and engage in arguments
is essential for these environments, while use of precedent cases is well-suited. 
Cases in our model are not merely considered as representations
of past data, but as flexible entities associated with the underlying view-point 
of an agent and the evolution of the corresponding discussion. The
paper provides an object-oriented description of the elements involved,
and illustrates their dependencies through a comprehensive example.

"On the Effectiveness of Evaluating Retrieval Systems
in the Absence of Relevance Judgments #

ABSTRACT
Soboro#, Nicholas and Cahan recently proposed a method
for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems without
relevance judgments. They demonstrated that the system
evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated
with actual evaluations using relevance judgments in the
TREC competition. In this work, we propose an explana­tion 
for this phenomenon. We devise a simple measure for
quantifying the similarity of retrieval systems by assessing
the similarity of their retrieved results. Then, given a collec­tion 
of retrieval systems and their retrieved results, we use
this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to
the other systems in the collection. We demonstrate that
evaluating retrieval systems according to average similarity
yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by
Soboro# et al., and we further demonstrate that these two
techniques are in fact highly correlated. Thus, the tech­niques 
are effectively evaluating and ranking retrieval sys­tems 
by ``popularity'' as opposed to ``performance.''

Abstract. We present a process model that applies casebased reasoning 
techniques to information system design. Describing the process
model we focus on similarity and case adaption aspects. We are currently 
implementing the process model in a research prototype called
CBModeler.
The CBModeler project shows how the development of information systems 
can be supported by reusing design specifications from former
projects. It assumes that all designs are derived from a reference model
that describes the most important aspects of a specific information system 
domain. Thus we are also integrating schemabased and modelbased reasoning techniques.
We introduce the notion of design and design component, similarity and
adaption process. Furthermore, we describe how a metamodel can be
used to preserve system wide consistency and a reference model to preserve 
consistency in a domain. Finally, we give a simple design scenario.References

"Improved Noise­Tolerant Learning and Generalized Statistical Queries

Abstract
The statistical query learning model can be viewed as a tool for creating (or demon­strating 
the existence of) noise­tolerant learning algorithms in the PAC model. The
complexity of a statistical query algorithm, in conjunction with the complexity of sim­ulating 
SQ algorithms in the PAC model with noise, determine the complexity of the
noise­tolerant PAC algorithms produced. Although roughly optimal upper bounds have
been shown for the complexity of statistical query learning, the corresponding noise­
tolerant PAC algorithms are not optimal due to ine#cient simulations. In this paper
we provide both improved simulations and a new variant of the statistical query model
in order to overcome these ineficiencies.
We improve the time complexity of the classification noise simulation of statistical
query algorithms. Our new simulation has a roughly optimal dependence on the noise
rate. We also derive a simpler proof that statistical queries can be simulated in the
presence of classification noise. This proof makes fewer assumptions on the queries
themselves and therefore allows one to simulate more general types of queries.
We also define a new variant of the statistical query model based on relative error, and
we show that this variant is more natural and strictly more powerful than the standard
additive error model. We demonstrate e#cient PAC simulations for algorithms in this
new model and give general upper bounds on both learning with relative error statistical
queries and PAC simulation. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be
simulated in the PAC model with malicious errors in such a way that the resultant PAC
algorithm has a roughly optimal tolerable malicious error rate and sample complexity.
Finally, we generalize the types of queries allowed in the statistical query model. We
discuss the advantages of allowing these generalized queries and show that our results
on improved simulations also hold for these queries.

Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) allows first-order 
learning and provides greater expressiveness than propositional learning. 
However, due to its tradeoff, the learning speed may not be reasonable for
datamining settings. To overcome this problem, this paper describes a
distributed implementation of an ILP engine, allowing speeding up 
optimal hypothesis searcb in inverse entailment according to the number
of processors. In this implementation, load balancing is achieved by 
contract net communication between the processors, resulting in a dynamic
allocation of the hypothesis search task. This paper describes our 
concurrent search algorithm, distributed implementation and experimental
results for speeding up inverse entailment. An initial experiment was
conducted to demonstrate the well-balanced task allocation.

Abstract. Case-based problem solving can be significantly improved
by applying domain knowledge (in opposition to problem solving knowledge), 
which can be acquired with reasonable effort, to derive explanations 
of the correctness of a case. Such explanations, constructed on
several levels of abstraction, can be employed as the basis for similarity
assessment as well as for adaptation by solution refinement. The general
approach for explanation-based similarity can be applied to different real
world problem solving tasks such as diagnosis and planning in technical
areas. This paper presents the general idea as well as the two specific,
completely implemented realizations for a diagnosis and a planning task.

"Refinement Operators Can Be (Weakly) Perfect

Liviu Badea and Monica Stanciu

AI Lab, Research Institute for Informatics
8-10 Averescu Blvd., Bucharest, Romania
e-mail: badea@ici.ro



Abstract. Our aim is to construct a perfect (i.e. minimal and optimal)
JLP refinement operator for hypotheses spaces bounded below by a most
specific clause and subject to syntactical restrictions in the form of input/output 
variable declarations (like in Progol). Since unfortunately
no such optimal refinement operators exist, we settle for a weaker form
of optimality and introduce an associated weaker form of subsumption
which exactly captures a first incompleteness of Progols refinement operator. 
We argue that this sort of incompleteness is not a drawback, as
it is justified by the examples and the MDL heuristic.
A second type of incompleteness of Progol (due to subtle interactions between 
the requirements of non-redundancy, completeness and the variable dependencies) 
is more problematic, since it may sometimes lead
to unpredictable results. We remove this incompleteness by constructing 
a sequence of increasingly more complex refinement operators which
eventually produces the first (weakly) perfect refinement operator for a
Progol-like ILP system.

ABSTRACT                                                         
A critical bottleneck exists in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) design and                          
development. It is tremendously difficult to observe, communicate with and test underwater robots,
because they operate in a remote and hazardous environment where physical dynamics and sensing
modalities are counter intuitive.
An underwater virtual world can comprehensively model all salient functional                           
characteristics of the real world in real time. This virtual world is designed from the perspective of
the robot, enabling realistic AUV evaluation and testing in the laboratory. 3D real-time graphics  
are our window into that virtual world.
Visualization of robot interactions within a virtual world permits sophisticated
analyses of robot performance that are otherwise unavailable. Sonar visualization permits
researchers to accurately ""look over the robot's shoulder"" or even ""see through the robot's eyes"" to
intuitively understand sensor-environment interactions.
Distribution of underwater virtual world components enables scalability and real-time
response. The IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol is used for compatible live
interaction with other virtual worlds. Network access allows individuals remote access. This is
demonstrated via MBONE collaboration with others outside The Edge, and Mosaic access to                                    
pertinentarchivedimages, papers,datasets,software, soundclips, text and any other computer storable media.                                                                                                        
This project presents the frontier of 3D real-time graphics for underwater robotics,
ocean exploration, sonar visualization and worldwide scientific collaboration.

"Integrating CBR and Heuristic Search for Learning and Reusing Solutions in Real-Time Task Scheduling

Abstract. This paper presents the Case-Based Reasoning Real-Time Scheduling 
System (CBR-RTS) that integrates into a case-based reasoning framework a
heuristic search component. The problem addressed involves scheduling sets of
tasks with precedence, ready time and deadline constraints. CBR-RTS reuses
the solution of known cases to simplify and solve new problems. When the
system does not have applicable cases, it tries to find a solution using heuristic
search. A particularly interesting feature of CBR-RTS is its learning ability.
New problems solved by the heuristic scheduler can be added to the case base
for future reuse. Performed tests have shown that small bases of cases carefully
chosen allow to substantially reduce the time needed to solve new complex
problems

"A Connectionist Indexing Approach for CBR Systems*

Abstract. An important factor that plays a major role in determining the performances
of a CBR system is the complexity and the accuracy of the case retrieval phase. Both flat
memory and inductive approaches suffer from serious drawbacks. In the first approach,
the search time becomes considerable when dealing with large scale memory base, while
in the second one the modifications of the case memory becomes very complex because
of its sophisticated architecture.
In this paper, we show how we can construct a simple efficient indexing system structure.
We construct a case hierarchy with two levels of memory: the lower level contains cases
organised into groups of similar cases, while the upper level contains prototypes, each
of which represents one group of cases. The construction of prototypes is made by using
an incremental prototype-based network. This upper level parallel memory is used as an
indexing system during the retrieval phase.

"Restructuring Chain Datalog Programs (Preliminary Report)


Anke Rieger

rieger@ls8.informatik.uni-dortmund.de


Abstract. The goal of knowledge compilation and program optimization 
is to transform programs in order to speed up their evaluation.
In machine learning, two major approaches to speed-up learning exist:
Those which interwine the learning and the optimization process and
those which clearly separate them. We follow the latter line of thought
and present a new restructuring method for chain Datalog programs
which have been learned by ILP algorithms. During the restructuring
process, rules for new, intermediate concepts are introduced which are
used to modify the original program. We proof that this transformation
does not change the coverage of a given set of learned target concepts.
We show the details of the implemented algorithm which has been successfully 
applied to a real-world robot navigation domain. Finally, we
show that the restructuring method yields a program which can be evaluated 
faster than the original one. This speed up is achieved by program
decompositions.

"Learning Prediction of Time Series. A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison of CBR with some other Approaches

Gholamreza Nakhaeizadeh

Wilhelm-Runge-Str. 11, Postfach 2360, D-89013 Ulm, Germany



Abstract
Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a rather new research area in Artificial 
Intelligence. The concept of K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) that can be
considered as a subarea of CBR traced back, however, to early fifties and
during the last years it is deeply investigated by the statistical community. 
In dealing with the task learning prediction of time series, besides
the KNN-approach, the Statistician have investigated other approaches
based on regression analysis and Box-Jenkins methods. Recently, neural
networks and symbolic machine learning approaches are applied to performing 
this task as well. Although learning prediction of time series is a
very important task in different scientific disciplines, there is no comprehensive 
study in the literature which compares the performance of CBR
with the performance of the other alternative approaches. The aim of this
paper is to contribute to this debate from a theoretical and empirical point
of view.

Abstract. The paper discusses the different aspects concerning performance 
arising in multi-modal systems combining Case-Based Reasoning
and Model-Based Reasoning for diagnostic problem solving. In particular, 
we examine the relation among speed-up of problems solving, competence 
of the system and quality of produced solutions. Because of the
well-know utility problem, there is no general strategy for improving all
these parameters at the same time, so the trade-off among such parameters 
must he carefully analyzed. We have developed a case memory
management strategy which allows the interleaving of learning of new
cases with forgetting phases, where useless and potentially dangerous
cases are identified and removed. This strategy, combined with a suitable 
tuning on the precision required for the retrieval of cases (in terms
of estimated adaptation cost), provides an effective mechanism for taking
under control the utility problem. Experimental analysis performed on a
real-world domain shows in fact that improvements over both speed-up
and competence can be obtained, without compromising in a significant
way the quality of solutions.

"Using a Case Base of Surfaces to Speed-Up Reinforcement Learning

Abstract. This paper demonstrates the exploitation of certain vision
processing techniques to index into a case base of surfaces. The surfaces 
are the result of reinforcement learning and represent the optimum
choice of actions to achieve some goal from anywhere in the state space.
This paper shows how strong features that occur in the interaction of
the system with its environment can be detected early in the learning
process. Such features allow the system to identify when an identical, or
very similar, task has been solved previously and to retrieve the relevant
surface. This results in an orders of magnitude increase in learning rate.

Abstract. This paper describes a CBR application in manufacturing industry, a
domain where CBR has by and large proved its applicability and success. The
paper details a thorough understanding of the field of fused cast manufacturing
basically seen from the perspective of glass furnace, where quality of glass
produced is straightaway related to the refractory blocks used in furnace linings.
The applicability of CBR paradigm is revisited in the present context. The CBR
process needed is conceptualized and designed. The paper describes the
evolution of the system beginning with tackling hurdles of knowledge
acquisition, a number of pitfalls in the prototype phase, to final implementation
of InfoFrax, the CBR system specially devised for the project. It gives an
overall description of the architecture and usage. The paper also reports the
immediate response to the software in form of direct user feedback,
expectations from the existing system, and some future work already underway
in the project.

"How Well Can Passage Meaning be Derived without Using Word Order? A Comparison of Latent Semantic Analysis and Humans

Abstract
How much of the meaning of a naturally occurring English
passage is derivable from its combination of words without
considering their order? An exploratory approach to this
question was provided by asking humans to judge the
quality and quantity of knowledge conveyed by short
student essays on scientific topics and comparing the inter­
rater reliability and predictive accuracy of their estimates
with the performance of a corpus­based statistical model
that takes no account of word order within an essay. There
was surprisingly little difference between the human judges
and the model.

"Universally Ideal Secret Sharing Schemes \Lambda

Amos Beimel y Benny Chor z
Department of Computer Science
Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel

Abstract
Given a set of parties f1; : : : ; ng, an access structure is a monotone collection of subsets of
the parties. For a certain domain of secrets, a secret sharing scheme for an access structure
is a method for a dealer to distribute shares to the parties. These shares enable subsets
in the access structure to reconstruct the secret, while subsets not in the access structure
get no information about the secret. A secret sharing scheme is ideal if the domains of the
shares are the same as the domain of the secrets. An access structure is universally ideal
if there exists an ideal secret sharing scheme for it over every finite domain of secrets. An
obvious necessary condition for an access structure to be universally ideal is to be ideal
over the binary and ternary domains of secrets. In this work, we prove that this condition
is also sufficient. We also show that being ideal over just one of the two domains does not
suffice for universally ideal access structures. Finally, we give an exact characterization for
each of these two conditions.

Abstract. The number of successful, small-scale and purpose-built applications 
of CBR is growing rapidly. However, CBR has so far not been
widely used as a methodology for reusing the large-scale data repositories 
typically maintained by a corporation. To facilitate this, cases must
no longer be considered as concretely represented at the data level, but
as virtual views of the underlying data. This paper argues that the basic
requirement to support virtual cases are mapping functions between different 
data representations. It is argued that the use of mapping functions
can increase flexibility in a number of ways. Multiple CBR applications
can exploit a single database. Similarly, a single case representation can
span multiple databases. Support for communication between different
CBR applications as well as the evolution of case representation within a
single application are also catered for by the same methodology. The paper 
provides reference to related work on database systems, with respect
to the issues of mapping function implementation and management.

Abstract We compare the performance of two database se­lection 
algorithms reported in the literature. Their perfor­mance 
is compared using a common testbed designed specif­ically 
for database selection techniques. The testbed is a de­composition 
of the TREC/TIPSTER data into 236 subcol­lections. 
The databases from our testbed were ranked using
both the gGlOSS and CORI techniques and compared to a
baseline derived from TREC relevance judgements. We ex­amined 
the degree to which CORI and gGlOSS approximate
this baseline. Our results confirm our earlier observation
that the gGlOSS Ideal(l) ranks do not estimate relevance­
based ranks well. We also find that CORI is a uniformly bet­ter 
estimator of relevance­based ranks than gGlOSS for the
test environment used in this study. Part of the advantage
of the CORI algorithm can be explained by a strong correla­tion 
between gGlOSS and a size­based baseline (SBR). We
also find that CORI produces consistently accurate rank­ings 
on testbeds ranging from 100--921 sites. However for a
given level of recall, search effort appears to scale linearly
with the number of databases.

Abstract
Traditionally work on multimedia structuring has been centered on the creation of indices and their use for
searching. Although searching is important there are many cases where the user just wants to browse through
the data to find something interesting without having any particular search goal. Multimedia data exhibits
hierarchical structure that can be exploited for more natural user interaction with the content.
In order to handle the large amounts of multimedia data more structure than what is currently available is
required. In this paper, we have focused on structuring multimedia data using trees to describe both temporal
and categorical relations. The pervasive use of trees to express hierarchies facilitates browsing, profiling, and
authoring. Our main target application is the implementation of a personalized TV-guide. The constraints
imposed by this application caused the development of a new simple compact graphical user interface for tree
browsing.

"Inferring Graphs from Walks
(Extended Abstract)

Abstract
We consider the problem of inferring an undirected, degree­bounded, edge­colored
graph from the sequence of edge colors seen in a walk of that graph. This problem can
be viewed as reconstructing the structure of a Markov chain from its output. (That is,
we are not concerned with inferring the transition probabilities, but only the underlying
graph structure of the Markov chain.) We present polynomial­time algorithms for the
inference of underlying graphs of degree­bound 2 (linear chains and cycles), based on
some surprising properties about the confluence of various sets of rewrite rules.

"Combining Rule-Based and Case-Based Learning for Iterative Part-of-Speech Tagging

Abstract. In this article we show how the accuracy of a rule based first
order theory may be increased by combining it with a case-based
approach in a classification task. Case-based learning is used when the
rule language bias is exhausted. This is achieved in an iterative
approach. In each iteration theories consisting of first order rules are
induced and covered examples are removed. The process stops when it
is no longer possible to find rules with satisfactory quality. The
remaining examples are then handled as cases. The case-based
approach proposed here is also, to a large extent, new. Instead of only
storing the cases as provided, it has a learning phase where, for each
case, it constructs and stores a set of explanations with support and
confidence above given thresholds. These explanations have different
levels of generality and the maximally specific one corresponds to the
case itself The same case may have different explanations representing
different perspectives of the case. Therefore, to classify a new case, it
looks for relevant stored explanations applicable to the new case. The
different possible views of the case given by the explanations
correspond to considering different sets of conditions/features to
analyze the case. In other words, they lead to different ways to compute
similarity between known cases/explanations and the new case to be
classified (as opposed to the commonly used global metric).
Experimental results have been obtained on a corpus of Portuguese
texts for the task of part-of-speech tagging with significant
improvement.

"Beyond the Query­By­Example Paradigm: New Query Interfaces for Music Information Retrieval

George Tzanetakis, Andreye Ermolinskyi, Perry Cook
Computer Science Department, Princeton University
email: gtzan@cs.princeton.edu

Abstract
The majority of existing work in music information re­trieval 
for audio signals has followed the content­-based
query­by­example paradigm. In this paradigm a musi­cal 
piece is used as a query and the result is a list of
other musical pieces ranked by their content similarity. 
In this paper we describe algorithms and graphical
user interfaces that enable novel alternative ways for
querying and browsing large audio collections. Computer 
audition algorithms are used to extract content
information from audio signals. This automatically ex­tracted 
information is used to configure the graphical
user interfaces and to genereate new query audio sig­nals 
for browsing and retrieval.

"Search and Adaptation in a Fuzzy Object Oriented Case Base

{ruet, laurent}@enit.fr



Abstract. In this paper we propose to represent a case using an object oriented
model that enables the description of imprecise knowledge using possibility
distributions. The proposed search process is based on this modeling and a
fuzzy similarity measure is defined. The adaptation process is achieved with
propagation of domain constraints in a neighborhood of the retrieved case. We
propose a method to define this neighborhood. We illustrate our proposition by
an example in the field of machining operation configuration.

Abstract. This paper presents a web based recommender system aimed
at supporting a user in information filtering and product bundling. The
system enables the selection of travel locations, activities and attractions,
and supports the bundling of a personalized travel plan. A travel plan is
composed in a mixed initiative way: the user poses queries and the recommender 
exploits an innovative technology that helps the user, when
needed, to reformulate the query. Travel plans are stored in a memory
of cases, which is exploited for ranking travel items extracted from catalogues. 
A new collaborative approach is introduced, where user past
behavior similarity is replaced with session (travel plan) similarity.

We present a spatial audio display technique that overcomes the 
presentation rate bottleneck of traditional monaural audio displays. 
Our compact speech display works by encoding message semantics 
into the acoustic spatialisation. In user testing, this display facilitated 
better recall of events than a conventional small screen visual display. 
Moreover, results showed that this mapping aided in the recall of the 
absolute position of events as opposed to merely their relative 
orders in a temporally ordered data set.

Abstract. We describe a GA-based concept learning/theory revision
system DOGMA and discuss how it can be applied to relational learning.
The search for better theories in DOGMA is guided by a novel fitness
function that combines the minimal description length and information
gain measures. To show the efficacy of the system we compare it to other
learners in two relational domains.

We describe a navigation tool for a collaborative Web space (CoWeb) containing meta information
on aggregated interaction history. We represent the history information by annotating links 
inside the CoWeb. The navigation tool presents all links on a page together with their meta 
information in a popup menu. A sonification gives an auditory overview of the distribution of
history information. The popup menu itself uses both conventional link markers as well as sound 
to communicate the meta information to the user.

Abstract. This paper presents an experimental comparison of two Inductive 
Logic Programming algorithms, PROGOL and TILDE, with C4.5,
a propositional learning algorithm, on a propositional dataset of road
traffic accidents. Rebalancing methods are described for handling the
skewed distribution of positive and negative examples in this dataset ,
and the relative cost of errors of commission and omission in this domain. 
It is noted that before the use of these methods all algorithms
perform worse than majority class. On rebalancing, all did significantly
better. The conclusion drawn from the experimental results is that on
such a propositional dataset ILP algorithms perform competitively in
terms of predictive accuracy with propositional systems, but are significantly 
outperformed in terms of time taken for learning.

Abstract. Most applications of inductive logic programming focus on
prediction or the discovery of new knowledge. We describe a less common
application of ILP namely verification and validation of knowledge based
systems and multi-agent systems. Using inductive logic programming,
partial declarative specifications of the software can be induced from the
behaviour of the software. These rules can be readily interpreted by the
designers or users of the software, and can in turn result in changes to the
software. The approach outlined was tested in the domain of multi-agent
systems, more in particular the RoboCup domain.

Abstract
This paper focuses on research in development of
semantics-oriented multimedia information retrieval
techniques. Semantics-oriented information retrieval
addresses the effectiveness of the retrieval. With
the goal of significantly improving retrieval precision
and query capability, image understanding technologies 
are applied to develop effective retrieval techniques. 
Specifically, three techniques are developed by
combining IU technologies (i.e., face detection) with
other existing or developed techniques (i.e., text indexing, 
conventional similarity matching, and face
identification) for image retrieval. These techniques
are evaluated to demonstrate the significance of the
semantics-oriented multimedia information retrieval.

"Examining Locally Varying Weights for Nearest Neighbor Algorithms

Nicholas Howe and Claire Cardie

Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14850.
E-mail: nihowe@cs.cornell.edu; cardie@cs.cornell.edu


Abstract. Previous work on feature weighting for case-based learning
algorithms has tended to use either global weights or weights that vary
over extremely local regions of the case space. This paper examines the
use of coarsely local weighting schemes, where feature weights are allowed
to vary but are identical for groups or clusters of cases. We present a new
technique, called class distribution weighting (CDW), that allows weights
to vary at the class level. We further extend CDW into a family of related
techniques that exhibit varying degrees of locality, from global to local.
The class distribution techniques are then applied to a set of eleven
concept learning tasks. We find that one or more of the CDW variants
significantly improves classification accuracy for nine of the eleven tasks.
In addition, we find that the relative importance of classes, features, and
feature values in a particular domain determines which variant is most
successful.

"Learning a Local Similarity Metric for Case-Based Reasoning

Francesco Ricci and Paolo Avesani

Abstract. This paper presents a new class of local similarity metrics,
called AASM, that are not symmetric and that can be adopted as the
basic retrieval method in a CBR system. An anytime learning procedure 
is also introduced that, starting from an initial set of stored cases,
improves the retrieval accuracy by modifying the local definition of the
metric. The learning procedure is a reinforcement learning algorithm and
can be run as a black box since no particular setting is required. With
the aid of classical test sets it is shown that AASM can improve in many
cases the accuracy of both nearest neighbour methods and Salzbergs
NGE. Moreover, AASM can achieve significant data compression (10%)
while maintainig the same accuracy as NN.

Abstract. Least common generalization under relative subsumption
(LGRS) is a fundamental concept in Inductive Logic Programming. In
this paper we give several new conditions for the existence of LGRSs.
In previous researches the existence of LGRSs was guaranteed when a
background theory is logically equivalent to conjunction of finitely many
ground literals. Each of our conditions allows a background theory to
have clauses with variables in it. The conditions are obtained using the
bottom method (or the bottom generalization method), with which any
clause subsuming a positive example relative to a background theory can
be derived. We also compare the conditions with those for the existence
of relative least generalizations under generalized subsumption (LGGSs) .

"Hybrid­Search and Storage of Semi­structured Information

Eytan Adar

Abstract
Given today's tangle of digital information, one of the hardest tasks for information
systems users is finding anything in the mess. For a number of well documented
reasons including the amazing growth in the Internet's popularity and the drop in
the cost of storage, the amount of information on the net, as well as on a user's local
computer has increased dramatically in recent years. Although this readily available
information should be extremely beneficial for computer users, paradoxically it is now
much harder to find anything.
Many different solutions have been proposed to the general information seeking
task of users, but few if any have addressed the needs of individuals or have leveraged
the benefit of single­user interaction. The Haystack project is an attempt to answer
the needs of the individual user. Creating such a system requires solving two problems.
Half the problem addresses the manipulation of the data into a queryable format.
Once the user's information is represented in Haystack, the other half of the problem
centers around our desire to answer the highly varied questions a user may ask about
this information. In this thesis we will propose a means of representing information
in a robust model within Haystack and we will describe a corresponding mechanism
by which the diverse questions of the individual can be answered. This novel method
functions by using a combination of existing information systems. We will call this
combined system a hybrid­search system.

"A Fuzzy Case Retrieval Approach Based on SQL for Implementing Electronic Catalogs

Abstract. Providing a flexible and efficient way of consulting a catalog
in e-commerce applications is of primary importance in order to guarantee 
the customer with a set of products actually related to his/her interests. 
ost electronic catalogs exploit standard database techniques both
for storage and retrieval of product information. However, a naive application 
of ordinary databases may produce unsatisfactory results, since
standard query tools are not able to retrieve information (i.e. products)
that only partially match the user/customer specification. The use of
CBR may alleviate some of the above problems, because of the ability
of a CBR system of retrieving products having characteristics similar
to the ones specified by the user. While the majority of the approaches
is based on k-NN retrieval techniques, in the present paper we propose
fuzzy-based retrieval as a natural way for implementing flexible search on
electronic catalogs. Since the exploitation of standard DBMS technology
is of paramount importance for deploying any E-commerce application,
we also propose to use a fuzzy extension to SQL for retrieving a set of
products that the customer specifies using precise as well as vague or imprecise 
features. The proposed implementation is based on a client/server
web-based architecture working on top of a relational standard DBMS. A
specific example concerning an on-line wine shop is used to demonstrate
the capabilities of the approach.

Abstract. Both propositional and relational learning algorithms require
a good representation to perform well in practice. Usually such a representation 
is either engineered manually by domain experts or derived
automatically by means of so-called constructive induction. Inductive
Logic Programming (ILP) algorithms put a somewhat less burden on the
data engineering effort as they allow for a structured, relational representation 
of background knowledge. In chemical and engineering domains,
a common representational device for graph-like structures are so-called
non-determinate relations. Manually engineered features in such domains
typically test for or count occurrences of specific substructures having
specific properties. However, representations containing non-determinate
relations pose a serious efficiency problem for most standard ILP algorithms. 
Therefore, we have devised a stochastic algorithm to automatically 
derive features from non-determinate background knowledge. The
algorithm conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each
clause represents a binary feature. These features are used instead of
the non-determinate relations in a subsequent induction step. In contrast 
to comparable algorithms search is not class-blind and there are
no arbitrary size restrictions imposed on candidate clauses. An empirical 
investigation in three chemical domains supports the validity and
usefulness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract. Knowledge in a case-based reasoning (CBR) system is often
more extensive than simply the cases, therefore knowledge engineering
may still be very demanding. This paper offers a first step towards an
automated knowledge acquisition and refinement tool for non-case CBR
knowledge. A data-driven approach is presented where a Genetic Algorithm 
learns effective feature selection for inducing case-base index, and
feature weights for similarity measure for case retrieval. The optimisation 
can be viewed as knowledge acquisition or maintenance depending
on whether knowledge is being created or refined. Opt imising CI3R retrieval 
is achieved using cases from the case-base and only minimal expert
input, and so can he easily applied to an evolving case-base or a changing
environment. Experiments with a real tablet formulation problem show
the gains of simultaneously optimising the index and similarity measure.
Provided that the available data represents the problem domain well, the
optimisation has good generalisation properties and the domain knowledge 
extracted is comparable to expert knowledge.

"Reducing the Servers' Computation in Private Information
Retrieval: PIR with Preprocessing 

Amos Beimel y Yuval Ishai z Tal Malkin x
June 9, 2003

Abstract
Private information retrieval (PIR) enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database,
replicated among one or more servers, while hiding the identity of the retrieved item. This
problem was suggested by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan in 1995, and since then
efficient protocols with sub-linear communication were suggested. However, in all these protocols
the servers' computation for each retrieval is at least linear in the size of entire database, even
if the user requires only a single bit.
In this paper, we study the computational complexity of PIR. We show that in the standard
PIR model, where the servers hold only the database, linear computation cannot be avoided. To
overcome this problem we propose the model of PIR with preprocessing: Before the execution of
the protocol each server may compute and store polynomially-many information bits regarding
the database; later on, this information should enable the servers to answer each query of the
user with more eÆcient computation.
We demonstrate that preprocessing can significantly save work. In particular, we construct
for any constants k  2 and  > 0: (1) a k-server protocol with O(n 1=(2k 1) ) communication,
O(n= log 2k 2 n) work, and O(n 1+ ) storage; (2) a k-server protocol with O(n 1=k+ ) communication 
and work and n O(1) storage; (3) a computationally-private k-server protocol with O(n  )
communication, O(n 1=k+ ) work, and n O(1) storage; and (4) a protocol with a polylogarithmic
number of servers, polylogarithmic communication and work, and O(n 1+ ) storage. On the
lower bounds front, we prove that the product of the extra storage used by the servers (i.e., in
addition to the length of the database) and the expected amount of work is at least linear in n.
Finally, we suggest two alternative models to saving computation, by batching queries and by
allowing a separate online interaction per future query.

Abstract. This paper presents a CBR application in the domain of industrial 
supervision. The domain knowledge is acquired at design stage
through different models and some critical prototypical situations. At
operating stage, new situations and their associated supervision strategy 
complete the supervision system and are reused by adaptation in
later situations in similar contexts. The system can be viewed as an artificial 
operator who collects experiences from the operators in order to
propose relevant variants in similar situations. First, we present current
approaches in process supervision. Then, knowledge and cases representation 
that support case-based reasoning and the different stages of the
reasoning process are presented. We focus on case adaptation, and show
different degrees of case reuse, depending on available knowledge.

Abstract
While recent retrieval techniques do not
limit the number of index terms, out­ of­
vocabulary (OOV) words are crucial in
speech recognition. Aiming at retrieving
information with spoken queries, we fill
the gap between speech recognition and
text retrieval in terms of the vocabulary
size. Given a spoken query, we gener­ate a transcription and detect OOV words
through speech recognition. We then cor­respond detected OOV words to terms in­
dexed in a target collection to complete the
transcription, and search the collection for
documents relevant to the completed tran­scription. We show the effectiveness of
our method by way of experiments.

ABSTRACT
We present a unified model which, given the ranked lists
of documents returned by multiple retrieval systems in re­sponse 
to a given query, simultaneously solves the problems
of (1) fusing the ranked lists of documents in order to ob­tain 
a high­quality combined list (metasearch); (2) gener­ating 
document collections likely to contain large fractions
of relevant documents (pooling); and (3) accurately evalu­ating 
the underlying retrieval systems with small numbers
of relevance judgments (eficient system assessment). Our
approach is based on the Hedge algorithm for on­line learn­ing. 
In effect, our proposed system ``learns'' which docu­ments 
are likely to be relevant from a sequence of on­line
relevance judgments. In experiments using TREC data, our
methodology is shown to outperform standard methods for
metasearch, pooling, and system evaluation, often remark­
ably so.

Abstract
The aim of our participation in the topic distillation and the named page finding tasks of the
Web track is the evaluation of a well­founded modular probabilistic framework for Web Information
Retrieval, which integrates content and link analyses. The link analysis component of the framework
employs a new probabilistic approach, called the Absorbing Model, for calculating a measure of
popularity for documents induced from the Web graph.

ABSTRACT
In this paper I introduce the problem of displaying dynamic
information. I give several examples where an individual
must interact with information that is changing beyond her
control. The challenge in displaying this information is to
discover how the user's context can be maintained while
giving her access to the new information that becomes
available. The user should feel in control of the information
despite the fact that it is changing. This can be done
effectively by understanding what conceptual anchors the
user creates into the data, and keeping them constant while
changing the other information as needed.

Abstract                                                         
Research into the visualization of abstract data has resulted  
in a number of domain specific solutions as well as some       
more generic techniques for visualising        information.      
Similarly, the field of sonification has explored the display  
of information to the human auditory sense. As haptic          
displays such as force-feedback devices become more readily    
available, the sense of touch is also being used to help       
understand information. While applications that use multi-sensory 
information displays are becoming more common,       
frameworks to assist in design of these displays need to be    
developed. This paper extends a previously proposed            
structure of the visual design space to include hearing and  
touch and hence define a multi-sensory design space. It then  
correlates this space with another classification of the design
space based on metaphors. Metaphors are often used as a        
starting point in designing information displays. Metaphors    
allow the user to take advantage of existing cognitive         
models as well as ecologically-developed perceptual skills.    
Metaphors provide another useful structuring of this multi-sensory 
design space. Throughout the paper all discussions     
are illustrated using the UML modeling notation. UML is a      
standard notation frequently used to document the design of    
software systems.

Abstract                            
The basic auditory interface techniques of auditory icons, earcons, and sonification can deftly
address the needs of most domains. However, there are domains that cannot be adequately
addressed by any single one of these techniques. By combining the characteristics of these basic
techniques, hybrid auditory interface techniques can be created to cover those domains that 
auditory icons, earcons, or sonification cannot. This paper describes a methodology for creating hybrid
auditory interface techniques. This methodology is demonstrated through the development of a
sonification-auditory icons hybrid for use in a complex, supervisory control environment. The
Var se system  , which incorporates the sonification-auditory icons hybrid technique, is then developed 
to aid monitoring, fault detection, and fault isolation in a satellite-ground control environment.

Abstract. Inductive logic programming (ILP) is built on a foundation
laid by research in other areas of computational logic. But in spite of this
strong foundation, at 10 years of age ILP now faces a number of new 
challenges brought on by exciting application opportunities. The purpose of
this paper is to interest researchers from other areas of computational
logic in contributing their special skill sets to help JLP meet these 
challenges. The paper presents five future research directions for LLP and
points to initial approaches or results where they exist. It is hoped that
the paper will motivate researchers from throughout computational logic
to invest some time into doing ILP.

Abstract. Increasing diversity for case-based reasoning (CBR) is an issue that
has recently drawn the attention of researchers in the CBR field. Several
diversification techniques have been proposed and discussed in the literature.
However, whether and to what extent those techniques can bring about benefits
to end-users remains in question. In this paper, we report an experiment in
applying a diversification technique to a case-based diagnosis tool in a product
maintenance domain. The results of this offer some evidence in support of
diversification techniques.

Abstract
A recent innovation in computational learning theory is the statistical query (SQ)
model. The advantage of specifying learning algorithms in this model is that SQ
algorithms can be simulated in the PAC model, both in the absence and in the presence
of noise. However, simulations of SQ algorithms in the PAC model have non­optimal
time and sample complexities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for specifying
statistical query algorithms based on a type of relative error and provide simulations
in the noise­free and noise­tolerant PAC models which yield more efficient algorithms.
Requests for estimates of statistics in this new model take the form: ``Return an
estimate of the statistic within a 1 \Sigma ¯ factor, or return `?', promising that the statistic
is less than `.'' In addition to showing that this is a very natural language for specifying
learning algorithms, we also show that this new specification is polynomially equivalent
to standard SQ, and thus, known learnability and hardness results for statistical query
learning are preserved.
We then give highly efficient PAC simulations of relative error SQ algorithms. We
show that the learning algorithms obtained by simulating efficient relative error SQ
algorithms in both the absence of noise and in the presence of malicious noise have
roughly optimal sample complexity. We also show that the simulation of efficient rela­tive 
error SQ algorithms in the presence of classification noise yield learning algorithms
at least as efficient as those obtained through standard methods, and in some cases im­proved, 
roughly optimal results are achieved. The sample complexities for all of these
simulations are based on the d  metric which is a type of relative error metric useful
for quantities which are small or even zero. We show that uniform convergence with
respect to the d  metric yields ``uniform convergence'' with respect to (¯; `) accuracy.
Finally, while we show that many specific learning algorithms can be written as
highly efficient relative error SQ algorithms, we also show, in fact, that all SQ algo­rithms 
can be written efficiently by proving general upper bounds on the complexity
of (¯; `) queries as a function of the accuracy parameter ''. As a consequence of this
result, we give general upper bounds on the complexity of learning algorithms achieved
through the use of relative error SQ algorithms and the simulations described above.

"Time in Geographic Space: Report on the Specialist Meeting of Research Initiative 10

Max J. Egenhofer and Reginald G. Golledge
National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis
Report 94-9


Abstract
This report describes the Specialist Meeting of the National Center for Geographic
Information and Analysis (NCGIA) Research Initiative on Spatio-Temporal Reasoning
in GIS. This Research Initiative addresses space and time as it relates to objects and
people in geographic space. The Specialist Meeting for the Research Initiative was held
at Lake Arrowhead, CA May 8-11, 1993 to set and prioritize a research agenda. This
meeting followed the workshop on Temporal Relations in Geographic Information
Systems held in Orono (January 1990) and a joint seminar with European researchers on
Methods of Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in GIS held in San Miniato, Italy (September
1992), which served as a forum to assess the state-of-the-art in reasoning about
geographic space and time and started a dialog among different disciplines involved in
space-time reasoning. The focus of the Lake Arrowhead-workshop was on Time in
Geographic Space.                               
The primary goal of this report is to disseminate the results of the discussions and make
them available to other researchers. Discussions at the workshop focused on cognitive
and formalization issues as they relate to spatio-temporal reasoning. Participants
identified a research agenda consisting of three complementary parts:

studies of human cognitive representation, language, and culture with
         respect to geographic space and time;        

developments of formal systems for spatio-temporal reasoning; and

efforts to bridge the gap between human and formal systems with
         appropriate means for communication and interaction.

Workshop participants found over 60 researchable questions, which they categorized
according to this framework and subsequently prioritized. High priority was given to
research that increases our knowledge of cognitive spatial representations and how such
representations can be formalized. Also, the development of temporal taxonomies
recurred throughout the discussions. Several times the need for alternatives to the
snapshot space-time model were demanded, for instance by considering processes.
An edited book with revised and extended manuscripts of selected papers is in
preparation and scheduled to appear in early 1995.

Abstract. Existing electronic shops based on CBR technology allow
customers to search for adequate products by only specifying the attributes 
for the products in a fuzzy way. Unfortunately, most electronic
shops do not further support customers after the retrieval step. However,
especially configurable products could be customized at this stage. Based
on the approach of interactive adaptation operators, we present a flexible 
system architecture for a customization module which can be easily
integrated in electronic shops. Our approach of a modular adaptation
concept is implemented and currently tested within the ESPRIT project

ABSTRACT
People have cognitive limitations that make them sensitive to interruption.  These limitations
can cause people to make serious mistakes when they are interrupted.  Unfortunately, interruption of people is a
side effect of systems that allow users to delegate tasks to active background processes, like intelligent software
agents.  Delegation carries the costs of supervision, and that often includes being interrupted by subordinates.
User interfaces for these kinds of computer systems must be designed to accommodate peoples limitations relative 
to being interrupted.  A theory-based taxonomy of human interruption was used to identify the four known
methods for deciding when to interrupt people.  An experiment was conducted with 36 subjects to compare these
four different design approaches within a common context.  The results show important differences between the
four user interface design solutions to the problem of interrupting people in human-computer interaction (HCI).

"Noise Tolerant Algorithms for Learning and Searching

Abstract
We consider the problem of developing robust algorithms which cope with noisy data. In the
Probably Approximately Correct model of machine learning, we develop a general technique
which allows nearly all PAC learning algorithms to be converted into highly efficient PAC
learning algorithms which tolerate noise. In the field of combinatorial algorithms, we develop
techniques for constructing search algorithms which tolerate linearly bounded errors and 
probabilistic errors.
In the field of machine learning, we derive general bounds on the complexity of learning in
the recently introduced Statistical Query model and in the PAC model with noise. We do so
by considering the problem of improving the accuracy of learning algorithms. In particular, we
study the problem of \boosting"" the accuracy of \weak"" learning algorithms which fall within
the Statistical Query model, and we show that it is possible to improve the accuracy of such
learning algorithms to any arbitrary accuracy. We derive a number of interesting consequences
from this result, and in particular, we show that nearly all PAC learning algorithms can be
converted into highly eÆcient PAC learning algorithms which tolerate classification noise and
malicious errors.
We also investigate the longstanding problem of searching in the presence of errors. We
consider the problem of determining an unknown quantity x by asking \yes-no"" questions,
where some of the answers may be erroneous. We focus on two different models of error:
the linearly bounded model, where for some known constant r < 1=2, each initial sequence of
i answers is guaranteed to have no more than ri errors, and the probabilistic model, where
errors occur randomly and independently with probability p < 1=2. We develop highly efficient
algorithms for searching in the presence of linearly bounded errors, and we further show that
searching in the presence of probabilistic errors can be eÆciently reduced to searching in the
presence of linearly bounded errors.

Abstract. We propose an ILP system FOIL-I, which induces logic programs 
by a top-down method from incomplete samples. An incomplete
sample is constituted by some of positive examples and negative examples 
on a finite domain. FOIL-I has an evaluation function to estimate 
candidate definitions, the function which is composition of an
information-based function and an encoding complexity measure. FOILI 
uses a best-first search using the evaluation function to make use of
suspicious but necessary candidates. Other particular points include a
treatment for recursive definitions and removal of redundant clauses.
Randomly selected incomplete samples are tested with FOIL-I, Quinlans 
FOIL and Muggletons Progol. Compared with others FOIL-I can
induce target relations in many cases from small incomplete samples.

Abstract. Image Segmentation is a crucial step if extracting information from a
digital image. It is not easy to set up the segmentation parameter so that it fits
best over the entire set of images, which should be segmented. In the paper, we
propose a novel architecture for image segmentation method based on CBR,
which can adapt to changing image qualities and environmental conditions. We
describe the whole architecture, the methods used for the various components
of the systems and show how it performs on medical images.

ABSTRACT
In order to represent musical content, pitch and timing
information is utilized in the majority of existing work in
Symbolic Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Symbolic
representations such as MIDI allow the easy calculation of such
information and its manipulation. In contrast, most of the existing
work in Audio MIR uses timbral and beat information, which can
be calculated using automatic computer audition techniques.
In this paper, Pitch Histograms are defined and proposed as a way
to represent the pitch content of music signals both in symbolic
and audio form. This representation is evaluated in the context of
automatic musical genre classification. A multiple­pitch detection
algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch
Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and
significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple­pitch
detection, automatic musical genre classification results from
symbolic and audio data are compared. The comparison indicates
that Pitch Histograms provide valuable information for musical
genre classification. The results obtained for both symbolic and
audio cases indicate that although pitch errors degrade
classification performance for the audio case, Pitch Histograms
can be effectively used for classification in both cases.

Abstract. This paper presents a case-based authoring system for training
and educational applications. The system, called Ocram-CBR and
developed in JAVATM, can plan lessons for any application domain
whatsoever. Ocram-CBR contains a User Modeling module, capable of
building a representation of the user objectives and characteristics, that
allows personalizing the teaching interaction. A distinguishing feature of
the User Modeling module is the use of a hybrid approach, in which case-based 
components and an artificial neural network are integrated into
one coherent system so that each component performs the tasks for which
it is best suited. The Training module of Ocram-CBR plans lessons using
a library of cases indexed and successively retrieved by means of a
discrimination search and serial search. The system has been adapted for
a training course in Information Systems and for a second application
which will teach learners to write business letters more effectively.

Abstract. We present adapted inductive methods for learning similarities, parameter 
weights and diagnostic profiles for case-based reasoning. All of these methods
can be refined incrementally by applying different types of background knowledge. 
Diagnostic profiles are used for extending the conventional CBR to solve
cases with multiple faults. The context of our work is to supplement a medical
documentation and consultation system by CBR techniques, and we present an
evaluation with a real-world case base.

Abstract
A major obstacle to the construction of a probabilis­tic 
translation model is the lack of large parallel cor­pora. 
In this paper we first describe a parallel text
mining system that finds parallel texts automatically
on the Web. The generated Chinese­English paral­lel 
corpus is used to train a probabilistic translation
model which translates queries for Chinese­ English
cross­language information retrieval (CLIR). We will
discuss some problems in translation model training
and show the preliminary CLIR results.

Abstract . Compression measures used in inductive learners, such as
measures based on the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle,
provide a theoretically justified basis for grading candidate hypotheses.
Compression-based induction is appropriate also for handling of noisy
data. This paper shows that a simple compression measure can be used
to detect noisy examples. A technique is proposed in which noisy examples 
are detected and eliminated from the training set, and a hypothesis
is then built from the set of remaining examples. The separation of noise
detection and hypothesis formation has the advantage that noisy examples 
do not influence hypothesis construction as opposed to most standard 
approaches to noise handling in which the learner typically tries to
avoid overfitting the noisy example set. Experimental results in a KRK
(king-rook-king) chess endgame domain show the potential of this novel
approach to noise handling.

Abstract. Contrary to symbolic learning approaches, that represent a
learned concept explicitly, case-based approaches describe concepts implicitly
 by a pair (GB, sim), i.e. by a measure of similarity sim and a
set CB of cases. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning 
the learning power of the two approaches. In this article we will
study the relationship between the case base, the measure of similarity,
and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a
simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an
equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the hypothesis 
of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and case-based 
methods and show the interdependency between the measure used
by a case-based algorithm and the target concept.

Abstract. Work on first-order clustering has primarily been focused
on the task of conceptual clustering, i.e., forming clusters with symbolic 
generalizations in the given representation language. By contrast,
for propositional representations, experience has shown that simple algorithms 
based exclusively on distance measures can often outperform
their concept-based counterparts. In this paper, we therefore build on
recent advances in the area of first-order distance metrics and present
RDBC, a bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm for first-order
representations that relies on distance information only and features a
novel parameter-free pruning measure for selecting the final clustering
from the cluster tree. The algorithm can empirically be shown to produce 
good clusterings (on the mutagenesis domain) that, when used for
subsequent prediction tasks, improve on previous clustering results and
approach the accuracies of dedicated predictive learners.

Abstract
This paper describes the development of a hand-held environment
discovery tool for the blind. The nal device will be
compose do fa laser-based range sensor and of an onboard
processor. As the users wings the hand-held system around,
he/she will receive local range information by means of a
tactile interface. In addition, the time pro le of the range
will be analyzed by the onboard processor to detect environmental
features that are critical formobility, such as curbs,
steps and drop-offs. In our current implementation, range
is collected by a short-base line triangulation system formed
by a point laser and a miniaturized camera, producing readings at
framerate. An Extended Kalman lter is used to
track the range data and detect environmental features of
interest.

Abstract. This paper presents a new approach for learning general
knowledge in a diagnostic case-based system through the use of a neural 
network. We take advantage of the self-adapting nature of the neural 
network to discover the most relevant features and combination of
features for each diagnosis considered. The knowledge acquired by the
network is interpreted and mapped into symbolic diagnosis descriptors,
which are kept and used by the case-based system to guide its reasoning
process, to retrieve cases from a case library and to build explanations.
The neural network used in the learning process was the Combinatorial
Neural Model, a network that has been combined with other symbolic
approaches previously. The paper presents the method used to interpret
the knowledge learned in the neural network, as well as the guidelines
followed by the reasoning process of the CBR system. An initial experiment 
in clinical psychology is also reported, where the case-based model
introduced here was used to learn and represent the psychological proffle
of patients in evaluation for heart transplant.

Abstract. A Horn definition is a set of Horn clauses with the same head
literal. In this paper, we consider learning non-recursive, function-free
first-order Horn definitions. We show that this class is exactly learnable
from equivalence and membership queries. It follows then that this class
is PAC learnable using examples and membership queries. Our results
have been shown to be applicable to learning efficient goal-decomposition
rules in planning domains.

"Generalizing Refinement Operators to Learn Prenex Conjunctive Normal Forms

Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming considers almost exclusively
universally quantified theories. To add expressiveness we should consider 
general prenex conjunctive normal forms (PCNF) with existential
variables. ILP mostly uses learning with refinement operators. To extend
refinement operators to PCNF, we should first extend substitutions to
PCNF. If one substitutes an existential variable in a formula, one often 
obtains a specializtion rather than a generalization. In this article
we define substitutions to specialize a given PCNF and a weakly complete 
downward refinement operator. Based on this operator, we have
implemented a simple learning system PCL on some type of PCNF.

"Theoretical Analysis of Case Retrieval Method Based on Neighborhood of a New Problem

Abstract. The retrieval of similar cases is often performed by using the
neighborhood of a new problem. The neighborhood is usually defined
by a certain fixed number of most similar cases (k nearest neighbors) to
the problem. This paper deals with an alternative definition of neighborhood 
that comprises the cases within a certain distance, d, from the
problem. We present an average-case analysis of a classifier, the d-nearest
neighborhood method (d-NNh), that retrieves cases in this neighborhood
and predicts their majority class as the class of the problem. Our analysis
deals with rn-of-n/i target concepts, and handles three types of noise. We
formally compute the expected classification accuracy of d-NNh, then we
explore the predicted behavior of d-NNh. By combining this exploration
for d-NNh and one for k-nearest neighbor method (k-NN) in our previous
study, we compare the predicted behavior of each in noisy domains. Our
formal analysis is supported with Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract. Determining the context of a feature (i.e., the factors affecting 
the ranking of a feature within a case) has been subject of several
studies in analysis tasks, particularly for classification but not in synthesis 
tasks like planning. In this paper we will address this problem and
explain how the domain theory plays a key role in determining the context 
of a feature. We provide a characterization of the domain theory and
show that in domains meeting this characterization, the context can be
simplified. We also use explanation-based learning techniques to determine 
the context in domains not meeting the characterization. Our work
relates for the first time CBR, machine learning and planning theory to
determine the context of a feature.

"Qualitative Knowledge to Support Reasoning About Cases

Abstract. Our recipe planner for bioprocesses, Sophist, uses a semi-qualitative
model to reason about cases. The model represents qualitative knowledge about
the possible effects of differences between cases and about the possible causes
of observed problems. Hence, the model is a crucial resource of adaptation
knowledge. The model representation has been developed specifically to
support CBR tasks. The essential notion in this representation is that of an
influence. Representation of domain knowledge in an influence graph and a
mapping of case-features onto nodes of such a graph, enable a variety of
interesting reasoning tasks. Examples of such task illustrate how qualitative
reasoning and case-based reasoning support each other in complex planning
tasks.

Abstract: This paper focuses on integrating inductive inference and case-based reasoning. We
study integration along two dimensions: Integration of case-based methods with methods based
on general domain knowledge, and integration of problem solving and incremental learning
from experience. In the INRECA system, we perform case-based reasoning as well as TDIDT
(Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees) classification by using the same data structure called
the INRECA tree. We extract decision knowledge using a TDIDT algorithm to improve both the
similarity assessment by determining optimal weights, and the speed of the overall system by
inductive learning. The integrated system we implemented evolves smoothly along application
development time from a pure case-based reasoning approach, where each particular case is a
piece of knowledge, to a more inductive approach where some subsets of the cases are
generalised into abstract knowledge. Our proposed approach is driven by the needs of a
concrete pre-commercial system and real diagnostic applications. We evaluate the system on a
database of insurance risk for cars and an application involving forestry management in
Ireland.

Abstract
This paper presents a bootstrapping process
that learns linguistically rich extraction pat­terns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
High­precision classifiers label unannotated
data to automatically create a large training set,
which is then given to an extraction pattern
learning algorithm. The learned patterns are
then used to identify more subjective sentences.
The bootstrapping process learns many subjec­tive 
patterns and increases recall while main­taining high precision.

Abstract. This paper describes a software tool called CALIBRE (Candidate
Library Retrieval). The tool incorporates case-base reasoning to support the
extraction of candidate lists for targeted marketing campaigns. The tool has
been aimed at users in the marketing domain. This domain is characterised by
very large databases containing many Terabytes of customer related information. 
Large systems such as these require careful management of the queries
being submitted to optimise the use of processing and storage resources. The
CBR approach encourages consistent best practice as well as cutting down on
valuable negotiation time. An early prototype has been built and is currently
used for experimental purposes.

Abstract. Reuse of software knowledge is a principle for improving
productivity and reliability of software development. To achieve this, reuse must
be done systematically. This means that processes for retrieving, reusing,
revising, and retaining have to be defined. At the same time organizational issues
(such as the establishment of a separate organizational unit responsible for
organizational learning) must be considered. In this paper we compare software
knowledge reuse models to the CBR cycle of Aamodt and Plaza [1] and show
that the approaches are very similar. We suggest to extend the CBR cycle by
including organizational issues explicitly and conclude that CBR is a promising
technology for realizing software knowledge reuse if our suggested
organizational extensions are considered.

Abstract. Obtaining accurate structural alerts for the causes of chemical 
cancers is a problem of great scientific and humanitarian value. This
paper follows up on earlier research that demonstrated the use of Inductive 
Logic Programming (ILP) for predictions for the related problem of
mutagenic activity amongst nitroaromatic molecules. Here we are concerned 
with predicting carcinogenic activity in rodent bioassays using
data from the U.S. National Toxicology Program conducted by the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The 330 chemicals
used here are significantly more diverse than the previous study, and
form the basis for obtaining Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) relating 
molecular structure to cancerous activity in rodents. We describe
the use of the ILP system Progol to obtain SARs from this data. The
rules obtained from Progol are comparable in accuracy to those from
expert chemists, and more accurate than most state-of-the-art toxicity
prediction methods. The rules can also be interpreted to give clues about
the biological and chemical mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and make use
of those learnt by Progol for inutagenesis. Finally, we present details of,
and predictions for, an ongoing international blind trial aimed specifically
at comparing prediction methods. This trial provides ILP algorithms an
opportunity to participate at the leading-edge of scientific discovery.

Abstract. We describe an application in which museum visitors hunt for virtual 
history outdoors, capture it, and bring it back indoors for detailed inspection.
This application provides visitors with ubiquitous access to a parallel virtual
world as they move through an extended physical space. Diverse devices,        
including mobile wireless interfaces for locating hotspots of virtual activity 
outdoors, provide radically different experiences of the virtual depending upon
location, task, and available equipment. Initial reflections suggest that the  
physical design of such devices needs careful attention so as to encourage an  
appropriate style of use. We also consider the extension of our experience to  
support enacted scenes. Finally, we discuss potential benefits of using diverse
devices to make a shared underlying virtual world ubiquitously available       
throughout physical space.

Abstract. In this paper we investigate a new language for learning,
which combines two well-known representation formalisms, Description
Logics and Horn Clause Logics. Our goal is to study the feasability of
learning in such a hybrid description - horn clause language, namely
CARIN-ALN [LR98b] , in the presence of hybrid background knowledge,
including a Horn clause and a terminological component. After setting
our learning framework, we present algorithms for testing example coverage 
and subsumption between two hypotheses, based on the existential
entailment algorithm studied in[LR98b]. While the hybrid language is
more expressive than horn clause logics alone, the complexity of these
two steps for CARIN-ALN remains bounded by their respective complexity 
in horn clause logics.

Abstract. In this article, a case-based approach for managing cases
with a life cycle is introduced. The authors present an application for
the accompaniment and support of software engineers in their work of
specifying test cases. Some general aspects of corporate knowledge editing 
are discussed. The model of life cycles provides a solution for editing 
and retrieving cases with several degrees of maturity. It is realised
by persistent case numbers, explicit revision states, and a multi-layered
similarity function. Some experiments are performed with a prototypical
system.

Abstract
Latent Semantic Analysis is used as a technique for measuring the coherence of
texts. By comparing the vectors for two adjoining segments of text in a high­
dimensional semantic space, the method provides a characterization of the degree of
semantic relatedness between the segments. We illustrate the approach for
predicting coherence through re­analyzing sets of texts from two studies that
manipulated the coherence of texts and assessed readers' comprehension. The
results indicate that the method is able to predict the effect of text coherence on
comprehension and is more effective than simple term­term overlap measures. In
this manner, LSA can be applied as an automated method that produces coherence
predictions similar to propositional modeling. We describe additional studies
investigating the application of LSA to analyzing discourse structure and examine
the potential of LSA as a psychological model of coherence effects in text
comprehension.

"Case Based Reasoning, Fuzzy Systems Modeling and Solution Composition


Ronald R. Yager
Machine Intelligence Institute, Iona College
New Rochelle, NY 10801


Abstract
Fuzzy systems modeling technique and the case based reasoning methodology are briefly
described, It is then shown that these two approaches can be viewed as essentially involving
the same process, a matching step and a solution composition step. It is noted that in the
typical case based reasoning application the solution composition step is more difficult.
Two techniques are suggested to help in the solution composition task in case based
reasoning. The first, the weighted median, is useful in domains in which the action space
consists of an ordered collection of alternatives. The second, a variation of reinforcement
learning, is useful in domains in which the resulting actions involve a sequence of steps.

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present a mechanism, called perspectives, 
to describe declarative biases for case retrieval in structured
representations of cases. Our approach is based on the observation that,
in complex tasks, the identification of the relevant aspects for retrieval
in a given situation may involve the use of knowledge intensive methods.
This identification process requires dynamical decisions about the relevant 
aspects of a problem and usually forces to consider non predefined
retrieval indexes in the memory of cases. Declarative biases provide a
flexible way of constructing dynamical perspectives for retrieval in the
memory of cases. We have implemented the notion of perspectives in a
reflective object-centered representation language, called Noos, based on
feature terms. Finally, we have used perspectives as declarative biases for
retrieval in the Saxex application, a complex real-world case-based reasoning 
system for generating expressive performances of melodies based
on examples of human performances that are represented as structured
cases.

"Retrieving Adaptable Cases The Role of Adaptation Knowledge in Case Retrieval


Barry Smyth1 and Mark T. Keane2

Abstract. The retrieval of a suitable case is of crucial importance to the
success of case-based reasoning. A good criterion for judging ""case suitability"" 
is bow complex a case will be to adapt. However, it has proven
difficult to directly calculate this measure of case ""adaptability"" without 
incurring the full cost of adaptation. This has led most researchers
to exploit semantic similarity as a more tractable (albeit less accurate)
answer to the question of case suitability.
This paper describes an approach to case retrieval that allows case adaptability 
to be accurately measured whilst overcoming the problems which,
in the past, led to the adoption of seiuantic similarity based methods.
We argue that our approach benefits from improved retrieval accuracy,
flexibility, and greater overall problem solving efficacy. Our methods are
implemented in Déjà Vu, a case-based reasoning system for software design, 
and we use examples from Déjà Vu to demonstrate our ideas.

Abstract
The paper describes an XML annotation format and tool developed within the MUCHMORE project. The annotation scheme was
designed specifically for the purposes of Cross­Lingual Information Retrieval in the medical domain so as to allow both efficient and
flexible access to layers of information. We use a parallel English­German corpus of medical abstracts and annotate it with linguistic
information (tokenisation, part­of­speech tagging, lemmatisation and decomposition, phrase recognition, grammatical functions) as
well as semantic information from various sources. The annotation of medical terms/concepts, semantic types and semantic relations is
based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Additionally, we use EuroWordNet as a general­language resource in
annotating word senses and to compare domain­specific and general language use. A major aim of the project is also to complement
existing ontological resources by extracting new terms and new semantic relations. We present the annotation scheme, which is
conceptually related to stand­off annotation, and describe our tool for automatic semantic annotation.

"An Empirical Approach to Conceptual Case Frame Acquisition

Ellen Riloff and Mark Schmelzenbach

riloff@cs.utah.edu, schmelze@cs.utah.edu

Abstract
Conceptual natural language processing systems
usually rely on case frame instantiation to recog­nize 
events and role objects in text. But generat­ing 
a good set of case frames for a domain is time­
consuming, tedious, and prone to errors of omission.
We have developed a corpus­based algorithm for
acquiring conceptual case frames empirically from
unannotated text. Our algorithm builds on previ­ous 
research on corpus­based methods for acquiring
extraction patterns and semantic lexicons. Given
extraction patterns and a semantic lexicon for a do­main, 
our algorithm learns semantic preferences for
each extraction pattern and merges the syntacti­cally 
compatible patterns to produce multi­slot case
frames with selectional restrictions. The case frames
generate more cohesive output and produce fewer
false hits than the original extraction patterns. Our
system requires only preclassified training texts and
a few hours of manual review to filter the dictionar­ies, 
demonstrating that conceptual case frames can
be acquired from unannotated text without special
training resources.

In this paper, we present a formal theory of a behavioral L-system and describe as application a real
time structured L-system interpreter. The behavioral L-system is a timed, conditional, stochastic,
parametric and environmentally sensitive L-system which allows besides the modeling of plant and
fractal development the description and animation of autonomous actors completely defined by
production rules. Virtual environment including geometric objects, force fields and sounds and the
behaviors of actors can be defined using the same formalism of the behavioral L-systems.

"CBR in a Changing Environment

Abstract
Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has been proposed for design tasks in which past experience is
exploited to solve the current problem. Based on a study of experts, it is believed that a case based
approach would be appropriate as the basis for computer aided decision support system for
intemetwork design. However, certain characteristics of the intemetwork design domain require
that the state of the art in CBR be extended before it could be applied to intemetwork design.
A knowledge revision mechanism is proposed to extend the use of previous cases.
Knowledge revision updates information about design components and uses that information to
augment the case base, enabling the retrieval mechanism to select both from actual experiences
and from experiences which might have occurred had current devices been available at the time.
A computer program, CIDA, implements key portions of the model.
An empirical experiment was performed to validate the model. The results, blinded, were
graded by three evaluators. A statistical analysis of the evaluations indicates that CIDAs
performance is between that of experts and intermediates, but is significantly better than that of
human novices. An ablation experiment shows the extended CBR approach has advantages over
both existing state-of-the-art CBR systems and constraint satisfaction systems.

Abstract. This paper is focused on a class of metrics for the Nearest
Neighbor classifier, whose definition is based on statistics computed on
the case base. We show that these metrics basically rely on a probability 
estimation phase. In particular, we reconsider a metric proposed
in the 80s by Short and Fukunaga, we extend its definition to an input 
space that includes categorical features and we evaluate empirically
its performance. Moreover, we present a novel probability based metric,
called Minimum Risk Metric (MRM), i.e. a metric for classification tasks
that exploits estimates of the posterior probabilities. MRM is optimal,
in the sense that it optimizes the finite misclassification risk, whereas
the Short and Fukunaga Metric minimizes the difference between finite
risk and asymptotic risk. An experimental comparison of MRM with the
Short and Fukunaga Metric, the Value Difference Metric, and EuclideanHamming m
etrics on benchmark datasets shows that MRM outperforms
the other metrics. MRM performs comparably to the Bayes Classifier
based on the same probability estimates. The results suggest that MRM
can be useful in case-based applications where the retrieval of a nearest
neighbor is required.

"Some Properties of Inverse Resolution

Abstract. This paper studies the properties of inverse resolution in normal 
logic programs. The V-operators are known as operations for inductive 
generalization in definite logic programs. In the presence of negation
as failure in a program, however, the V-operators do not work as generalization 
operations in general and often make a consistent program
inconsistent. Moreover, they may destroy the syntactic structure of logic
programs such as acyclicity and local stratification. On the procedural
side, unrestricted application of the V-operators may lose answers computed 
in the original program and make queries flounder. We provide
sufficient conditions for the V-operators to avoid these problems.

ABSTRACT
In this article, a heuristic version of Multidimensional Scaling

like MDS, maps objects into an Euclideanspace, such
that similarities are preserved. In additionof being more eficient
than MDS it allows query­by­example type of query, which makes      
it suitable for a content­based retrieval purposes.               
is proposed to address this issue.

Abstract. This paper defines a selection problem which selects an 
appropriate object from a set that is specified by parameters. We discuss
inductive learning of selection problems and give a method combining
inductive logic programming (ILP) and Bayesian learning. It induces
a binary relation comparing likelihood of objects being selected. Our
methods estimate probability of each choice by evaluating variance of an
induced relation from an ideal binary relation. Bayesian learning 
combines a prior probability of objects and the estimated probability. By
making several assumptions on probability estimation, we give several
methods. The methods are applied to Part-of-Speech tagging.

Abstract. Span programs provide a linear algebraic model of computa­tion. 
Lower bounds for span programs imply lower bounds for formula 
size, symmetric branching programs and for contact schemes. Monotone
span programs correspond also to linear secret­sharing schemes. We
present a new technique for proving lower bounds for monotone span
programs. We prove a lower bound of \Omega\Gamma m 2:5 ) for the 6­clique func­tion. 
Our results improve on the previously known bounds for explicit
functions.

Abstract. Relational reinforcement learning is presented, a learning
technique that combines reinforcement learning with relational learning 
or inductive logic programming. Due to the use of a more expressive
representation language to represent states, actions and Q-functions, relational 
reinforcement learning can be potentially applied to a new range
of learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is planning in the
blocks world, where it is assumed that the effects of the actions are unknown 
to the agent and the agent has to learn a policy. Within this simple
domain we show that relational reinforcement learning solves some existing 
problems with reinforcement learning. In particular, relational reinforcement 
learning allows to employ structural representations, to make
abstraction of specific goals pursued and to exploit the results of previous
learning phases when addressing new (more complex) situations.

Abstract. Computational visualization systems and techniques have improved information gathering
activities and changed ways Science is made. However, the complexity of the data handled by such systems
has suggested the need for alternative representation and display techniques. Auditory display has been
considered to be a real possibility in this area, in a field known as sonification. This paper describes the
approach, implementation and results of a prototype for a sonification system to support graphical techniques
in visualization applications. Results have shown that there are many possibilities for the inclusion of sound
tools in visualization systems, in ways that may ease data interpretation and improve performance in analysis
tasks.

Abstract. Case base maintenance is one of the most important issues
for current research in CaseBased Reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we
outline two novel steps as part of the maintenance phase of the CBR process. 
The review step covers assessment and monitoring of the knowledge
containers whereas the restore step actually modifies the contents of the
containers according to recommendations resulting from the review step.
Here, we focus our attention on the review step for the case base. For
this purpose, we define several quality measures based on different case
and case base properties that describe specific characteristics of the case
base such as correctness, consistency, uniqueness, minimality and incoherence. 
These measures allow an initial implementation of the review
step for the case base container. We conclude the paper with an outline
of future work to extend these aspects of maintenance in CBR.

Abstract
Most learning algorithms that are applied to text cat­
egorization problems rely on a bag­of­words document
representation, i.e., each word occurring in the docu­ment 
is considered as a separate feature. In this paper,
we investigate the use of linguistic phrases as input fea­tures 
for text categorization problems. These features
are based on information extraction patterns that are
generated and used by the AutoSlog­TS system. We
present experimental results on using such features as
background knowledge for two machine learning algo­
rithms on a classification task on the WWW. The re­sults 
show that phrasal features can improve the pre­cision 
of learned theories at the expense of coverage.

"Reducing Lexical Semantic Complexity with Systematic Polysemous Classes and Underspecification

Paul Buitelaar

Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3,
66123 Saarbrücken, Germany
paulb@dfki.de

Abstract
This paper presents an algorithm for finding
systematic polysemous classes in WordNet
and similar semantic databases, based on a
definition in (Apresjan 1973). The
introduction of systematic polysemous
classes can reduce the amount of lexical
semantic processing, because the number of
disambiguation decisions can be restricted
more clearly to those cases that involve real
ambiguity (homonymy). In many
applications, for instance in document
categorization, information retrieval, and
information extraction, it may be sufficient
to know if a given word belongs to a certain
class (underspecified sense) rather than to
know which of its (related) senses exactly to
pick. The approach for finding systematic
polysemous classes is based on that of
(Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), while
addressing some previous shortcomings.

"TileBars: Visualization of Term Distribution Information in Full Text Information Access

Marti A. Hearst

(415) 812­4742; hearst@parc.xerox.com

ABSTRACT
The field of information retrieval has traditionally focused on
textbases consisting of titles and abstracts. As a consequence,
many underlying assumptions must be altered for retrieval
from full­length text collections. This paper argues for mak­ing 
use of text structure when retrieving from full text doc­uments, 
and presents a visualization paradigm, called Tile­
Bars, that demonstrates the usefulness of explicit term distri­bution 
information in Boolean­type queries. TileBars simul­
taneously and compactly indicate relative document length,
query term frequency, and query term distribution. The pat­terns 
in a column of TileBars can be quickly scanned and de­
ciphered, aiding users in making judgments about the poten­tial 
relevance of the retrieved documents.

Abstract. One of the most challenging goals for the software development 
community is the definition and assessment of techniques and tools
enabling the cost estimation of projects in the early phases of the software 
life cycle. Despite of the increasing needs and the available tools
and methods, a satisfactory solution is still to be found.
During the last two years, has gained some interest in this community
an approach based on analogy. Following this approach, an estimation
is made starting from analogies with other software projects met in the
past. The main reason for this trend is the increased flexibility with respect 
to other approaches. The main drawback of this method was the
inadequacy of the software technologies to provide an effective and eflident 
implementation.
The experience reported here, demonstrates that CBR techniques allow
a natural implementation of the estimation by analogy paradigm, and
the software estimation by analogy in particular.

Abstract. Retrieval of cases is one important step within the case-based
reasoning paradigm. We propose an improvement of this stage in the
process model for finding most similar cases with an average effort of
O[log2n], n number of cases. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use the
heterogeneity of the search space for a density-based structuring and to
employ this precomputed structure, a k-d tree, for efficient case retrieval
according to a given similarity measure. Besides illustrating the basic
idea, we present empirical results of a comparison of four different k-d
tree generating strategies and introduce the notion of dynamic bounds
which significantly reduce the retrieval effort. The presented approach is
fully implemented and used within two case-based reasoning systems for
classification and diagnostic tasks, PATDEX and INRECA.

ABSTRACT
A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take
advantage of implicit higher­order structure in the association of terms with documents (""semantic
structure"") in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in
queries. The particular technique used is singular­value decomposition, in which a large term by
document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca 100 orthogonal factors from which the original
matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca 100 item
vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo­document vectors formed from
weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra­threshold cosine values are returned.
Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.

"An Interaction Model to Scientific Visualization Using Sound

VERIDIANA CHRISTIE LUCAS SALVADOR, ROSANE MINGHIM

{veri, rminghim}@icmc.sc.usp.br

Abstract: In scientific visualization, interaction tools allow users to navigate through volume and explore its
features, helping information understanding. The use of sound as a data display tool (sonification) has also
been shown to support information understanding and may help dealing with adding dimensions to a visual
display. However, thus far those issues have been treated separately by the visualization community. This
paper presents an interaction model for scientific visualization that considers the main issues related to
sonification, and shows a prototype implemented to sample the proposed model.

"Retrieving Gases in Structured Domains by Using Goal Dependencies *

Abstract. Structured domains are characterized by the fact that there
is an intrinsic dependency between certain key elements in the domain.
Considering these dependencies leads to better performance of the planning 
systems, and it is an important factor for determining the relevance
of the cases stored in a case-base. However, testing for cases that meet
these dependencies, decreases the performance of case-based planning, as
other criterions need also to be consider for determining this relevance.
We present a domain-independent architecture that explicitly represents
these dependencies so that retrieving relevant cases is ensured without
negatively affecting the performance of the case-based planning process.

New Interfaces for Musical Expression must speak to the

Abstract. We consider the task of tagging Slovene words with morphosyntactic 
descriptions (MSDs). MSDs contain not only part-of-speech
information but also attributes such as gender and case. In the case of
Slovene there are 2,083 possible MSDs. P-Progol was used to learn morphosyntactic 
disambiguation rules from annotated data (consisting of
161,314 examples) produced by the MULTEXT-East project. P-Progol
produced 1,148 rules taking 36 hours. Using simple grammatical background 
knowledge, e.g. looking for case disagreement, P-Progol induced
4,094 clauses in eight parallel runs. These rules have proved effective
at detecting and explaining incorrect MSD annotations in an independent 
test set, but have not so far produced a tagger comparable to other
existing taggers in terms of accuracy.

"Improved Bicriteria Existence Theorems for Scheduling

Javed Aslam # April Rasala + Cli# Stein # Neal Young §
Dartmouth College

Two common objectives for evaluating a schedule
are the makespan, or schedule length, and the average
completion time. In this note, we give improved bounds
on the existence of schedules that simultaneously opti­mize 
both criteria.
In a scheduling problem, we are given n jobs and
m machines. With each job j we associate a non­
negative weight w j . A schedule is an assignment of
jobs to machines over time, and yields a completion
time C j for each job j. We then define the average
completion time as # n
j=1 w j C j and the makespan as
Cmax = max j C j . We use C opt
max
and # w j C #
j
to denote
the optimal makespan and average completion time.
We will give results which will hold for a wide vari­ety 
of combinatorial scheduling problems. In particular,
we require that valid schedules for the problem satisfy
two very general conditions. First, if we take a valid
schedule S and remove from it all jobs that complete
after time t, the schedule remains a valid schedule for
those jobs that remain. Second, given two valid sched­ules 
S 1 and S 2 for two sets J 1 and J 2 of jobs (where
J 1 # J 2 is potentially nonempty), the composition of S 1
and S 2 , obtained by appending S 2 to the end of S 1 , and
removing from S 2 all jobs that are in J 1 # J 2 , is a valid
schedule for J 1 # J 2 .
For the rest of this note we will make claims about
``any'' scheduling problem, and mean any problem that
satisfies the two conditions above. In addition, if a
schedule has Cmax # #C opt
max
and # w j C j
# # # w j C # j
we call S an (#, #)­schedule.
Stein and Wein [7] recently gave a powerful but
simple theorem on the existence of schedules which are
simultaneously good approximations for makespan and
for average completion time. They showed that for any
scheduling problem, there exists a (2, 2)­schedule. The
construction is simple. We take an optimal average
completion time schedule and replace the subset J # of
jobs that finish after time C opt
max
by an optimal makespan
schedule for J # . The schedule has length at most 2C opt
max
,
and the completion time of each job at most doubles,
thus we obtain a (2,2)­schedule.
In the (2,2)­schedule, C opt
max
was the break­point, the
point at which we truncated the average completion
time schedule and started the makespan schedule on the
remaining jobs. By considering several di#erent break
points simultaneously, and taking the best one, Stein
and Wein show, via a complicated case analysis, how to
achieve improved approximations. In particular, they

Abstract. Case-based reasoning exploits memorized problem solving episodes,
called cases, in order to solve a new problem. Adaptation is a complex and crucial
step of case-based reasoning which is generally studied in the restricted framework 
of an application domain. This article proposes a first analysis of case adaptation 
independently from a specific application domain. It proposes to combine
the retrieval and adaptation steps in a unique planning process that builds an ordered 
sequence of operations starting from an initial state (the stated problem)
and leading to a final state (the problem once solved). Thus, the issue of case
adaptation can be addressed by studying the issue of plan adaptation. Finally, it is
shown how case retrieval and case adaptation can be related thanks to reformulations 
and similarity paths.

Abstract. The event calculus is a formalism for reasoning about actions
and change in dynamic systems. It has been used in diverse areas including 
planning and communications protocol specification. Writing event
calculus programs requires the construction of domain specific axioms
(DSAs) - a programming task which is non-trivial, and one that hinders 
the broader use of the event calculus. This work demostrates that
such axioms can be learned from temporal observations using hductive
Logic programming (ILP) techniques, in particular theory completion.
The theory of logical back-propagation as a mechanism for theory completion 
is described and its implementation in the ILP system Progol
is used here. These techniques were used to investigate learning DSAs
for the traditional AI blocks world. In the experiments Progol, utilising
logical back-propagation, learned correct DSAs. These results provide
encouragement and highlight the possibility of discovering causal relationships 
from data in temporal databases, and also learning the domain
specific knowledge necessary in the development of plans.

"A New Approach for the Incremental Development of Adaptation Functions for CBR

Abstract. This paper introduces a new approach to building complex
adaptation functions for case-based reasoning systems.
We present an incremental method which allows a domain expert to refine 
the existing adaptation function during use of the system. We lend
ideas from Ripple-Down Rules, a proven method for the very effective
and efficient acquisition of classification knowledge during the use of a
knowledge-based system. In our approach the expert is only required to
provide explanations of why, for a given problem, a certain adaptation
step should be taken. Incrementally a complex adaptation function as
a systematic composition of many simple adaptation functions is developed. 
This approach is effective with respect to both, the development
of highly tailored and complex adaptation functions for CBR as well as
the provision of an intuitive and feasible approach for the expert.
The approach has been implemented in our CBR system MIKAS, for the
design of menus according to dietary requirements.
While our approach showed very good results in MIKAS, it represents
also a promising technique for many other CBR applications.

ABSTRACT                                                                                                                
Data sonification is the representation of data using sound.  Last year we presented a flexible, interactive and portable data
sonification toolkit called LISTEN, that allows mapping of data to several sound parameters such as pitch, volume, timbre
and duration [20].  One of the potential drawbacks of LISTEN is that since the sounds generated are non-musical, they can
be fatiguing when exploring large data sets over extended periods of time.  A primary goal in the design of MUSE -- a   
MUsical Sonification Environment -- is to map scientific data to musical sounds.  The challenge is to ensure that the data
meanings are preserved and brought out by these mappings.  MUSE provides flexible data mappings to musical sounds       
using parameters such as pitch (melody), rhythm, tempo, volume, timbre and harmony.  MUSE is written in C++ for the     
SGI platform and works with the freely available sound specification software CSound developed at MIT.  We have applied 
MUSE to map uncertainty in some scientific data sets to musical sounds.

Abstract
An important aspect of word sense disambiguation is the evaluation of different methods and parameters. Unfortunately, there is a lack
of test sets for evaluation, specifically for languages other than English and even more so for specific domains like medicine. Given
that our work focuses on English as well as German text in the medical domain, we had to develop our own evaluation corpora in
order to test our disambiguation methods. In this paper we describe the work on developing these corpora, using GermaNet and UMLS
as (lexical) semantic resources, next to a description of the annotation tool KiC that we developed for support of the annotation task.

Abstract. An exemplar-based model with foundations in Bayesian networks 
is described. The proposed model utilises two Bayesian networks:
one for indexing of categories, and another for identifying exemplars
within categories. Learning is incrementally conducted each time a new
case is classified. The representation structure dynamically changes each
time a new case is classified and a coverage function is used as a basis
for selecting suitable exemplars. Finally, a simple example is given to
illustrate the concepts in the model.

"Latent Semantic Analysis Approaches to Categorization

Darrell Laham

dlaham@psych.colorado.edu

Many computational models of semantic memory rely on
vector representations of concepts based on explicit encoding
of arbitrary feature sets. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
creates high dimensional (n = 300+) vectors for concepts in
semantic memory through statistical analysis of a large rep­resentative 
corpus of text rather than subjective feature sets
linked to object names (for details see Landauer & Dumais,
1997; Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, in press). Concepts can be
compared in the semantic space and their similarity indexed
by the cosine of the angle between vectors.
Computational models of concept relations using LSA
representations demonstrate that categories can be emergent
and self­organizing based exclusively on the way language is
used in the corpus without explicit hand­coding of category
membership or semantic features. LSA categorization is
context dependent and occurs through a dynamic process of
induction. Semantic ``meaning'' is not encapsulated within
an object representation, but emerges as the set of relation­
ships between selected objects in a context­based sub­space.
Neuropsychological studies (e.g. Warrington & Shallice,
1984) point to a class of patients who exhibit disnomias for
specific categories of objects (natural kinds) while retaining
the ability to name other objects (man­made artifacts). The
objects from natural kind categories tend to be significantly
more clustered in LSA space than are those from artifact
categories. If brain structure corresponds to LSA structure,
the identification of concepts belonging to strongly clustered
categories should suffer more than weakly clustered concepts
when their representations are partially damaged.
Three types of modeling experiments were conducted:
matching base concept names to superordinate categories in
forced­choice testing, correlating LSA similarity measures to
human judgments of typicality, and multivariate analyses of
similarity matrices to capture category boundaries.
For the forced­choice matching of concept names to
superordinate categories, a selection of 140 objects (rated as
most typical in their category) from 14 categories was used.
Each object name was compared to each of the 14 category
names (apple---flower, apple---mammal, etc.). The LSA
match was considered correct when the highest cosine
comparison in the set was between an object and its relevant
superordinate (apple---fruit). The results show that in all 14
categories, LSA predicts membership well above chance
(chance = 7%), however, there are differences in the degree of
clustering: the percent correct for animate natural kinds
(flowers, mammals, fruit, trees, vegetables, and birds) =
92%; for inanimate natural kinds with observed deficits in
neuropsychological patients (gemstones, musical instr­uments) = 
100%; and for man­made artifacts (furniture,
vehicles, weapons, tools, toys, and clothing) = 53%.
Correlations between LSA similarity judgments and hu­man 
typicality judgments were consistently better for the
natural kinds than for the artifacts. For natural categories,
LSA similarities (cosine between concept and either
superordinate name, most typical member, or centroid of all
members) showed high correlations with human judgments
(e.g. fruit: r = .82), while artifact similarities showed low to
near­zero correlations with human judgments.
As illustrated in Figure 1, multivariate analyses of LSA­
based similarity matrices show more cohesive structure for
natural kinds than for artifacts. Factors 4­6 in this analysis
load high on concepts in the bird category---additional
factors (7­15) load on specific artifact concepts (not shown).

Abstract. In this paper, we present a new method based on nonmonotonic
learning where the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithm is used twice
and apply our method to acquire graphic design knowledge. Acquiring
design knowledge is a challenging task because such knowledge is complex and
vast. We thus focus on principles of layout and constraints that layouts must
satisfy to realize automatic layout generation. Although we do not have
negative examples in this case, we can generate them randomly by considering
that a page with just one element moved is always wrong. Our nonmonotonic
learning method introduces a new predicate for exceptions. In our method, the
ILP algorithm is executed twice, exchanging positive and negative examples.
From our experiments using magazine advertisements, we obtained rules
characterizing good layouts and containing relationships between elements.
Moreover, the experiments show that our method can learn more accurate rules
than normal ILP can.

Abstract. Dissatisfaction with existing standard case-based reasoning
(CBR) systems has prompted us to investigate how we can make these
systems more creative and, more broadly, what would it mean for them to
be more creative. This paper discusses three research goals: understanding 
creative processes better, investigating the role of cases and CBR
in creative problem solving, and understanding the framework that supports 
this more interesting kind of case-based reasoning. In addition, it
discusses methodological issues in the study of creativity and, in particular, 
the use of CBR as a research paradigm for exploring creativity.

Abstract. Nowadays, the complexity involved in computer network fault
management demands a great amount of information about the involved
technologies and their associated problems. Besides, Trouble Ticket Systems
have been used to store the occurred problems, actuating as an historical
memory of the network. Thus, a correct approach to consolidate the network
historic memory is the development of an expert system that takes in account
the knowledge accumulated in the Trouble Ticket Systems to propose
solutions for an average problem. This work presents a system that uses Case-Based 
Reasoning paradigm applied to a Trouble Ticket System to suggest
solutions for a new problem occurred. This system aims to aid diagnosis and
resolution stages of network management problems. Typical problems of this
domain, the proposed solution and results reached with the developed
prototype are described.

Abstract. The paper presents the decision list learning system CLOG
and the results of using it to learn nominal inflections of English, Romanian, 
Czech, Slovene, and Estonian. The dataset used to induce rules
for the synthesis and analysis of the inflectional paradigms of nouns and
adjectives of these languages is the MULTEXT-East multilingual tagged
corpus. The ILP system FOIDL is also applied to the same dataset, and
this paper compares the induction methodology and results of the two
systems. The experiment shows that the accuracy of the two systems
is comparable when using the same training set. However, while FoIDL
is, due to efficiency reasons, severely limited in the size of the training
set, CLOG does not suffer from such limitations. With the increase of the
training set size possible with CLOG, it significantly outperforms FoIDL
and learns highly accurate morphological rules.

Abstract. The integration of rule-based and case-based reasoning is
particularly useful in medical applications, where both general rules aud
specific patient cases are usually available. In the present paper we aim at
presenting a decision support tool for Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 
management relying on such a kind of integration. This multimodal
reasoning system airirs at providing physicians with a simitable solution to
the problem of therapy planning by exploiting, in the most flexible way,
the strengths of the two selected methods. In particular, the integration is
pursued without considering one of the modality as the most prominent
reasoning method, but exploiting complementarity in all possible ways.
In fact, while rules provide suggestions on the basis of a situation detection 
mechanism that relies on structured prior knowledge, CBR may be
used to specialize and dynamically adapt the rules on the basis of the
patients characteristics armd of the accumulated experience. On the other
hand, if a particular patient class is not sufficiently covered by cases, the
use of rules may be exploited to try to learn suitable situations, in order
to improve the competence of the case-based component. Such a work
will be integrated in the EU funded project T-IDDM architecture, and
has been preliminary tested on a set of cases generated by a diabetic
patient simulator.

Abstract. Case adaptation, a central component of case-based reasoning, 
is often considered to be the most difficult part of a case-based
reasoning system. The difficulties arise from the fact that adaptation often 
does not converge, especially if it is not done in a systematic way.
This problem, sometimes termed the assimilation problem, is especially
pronounced in the case-based design problem solving domain where a
large set of constraints and features are processed. Furthermore, in the
design domain, multiple cases must be considered in conjunction in order
to solve the new problem, resulting in the difficulty of how to efficiently
combine the cases into a global solution for the new problem.
In order to achieve case combination, we investigate a methodology which
formalizes the process using constraint satisfaction techniques. We represent 
each case as a primitive constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and
apply an existing repair-based CSP algorithm to combine these primitive 
CSPs into a globally consistent solution for the new problem. The
run time is satisfactory for providing a quick and explicable answer to
whether existing cases can be adapted or if new cases would have to be
created.
We have tested our methodology in the configuration design and assembly 
sequence generation domains.

The goal of the presented project is a general compositonal environment for multimedia with 
interactive editing facilities. Multimedia presentations are regarded as hierarchical compositions
of time objects that define serial or parallel synchronisation of the inserted media  
objects. Such media composition hierarchies support automatic temporal layout mechanisms    
and are integrated into an object-oriented application framework that provides direct       
manipulative interaction on temporal structures through user interface components. In this  
papaer reusable and extendable components for audio and music processing are presented.

Abstract. We consider the learnability of classes of logic programs in
the presence of noise, assuming that the label of each example is reversed
with a fixed probability. We review the polynomial PAC learnability of
nonrecursive, determinate, constant-depth Horn clauses in the presence
of such noise. This result is extended to an analogous class of recursive
logic programs that consist of a recursive clause, a base case clause, and
ground background knowledge. Also, we show that arbitrary nonrecursive 
Horn clauses with forest background knowledge remain polynomially
PAC learnable in the presence of noise. We point out that the sample
size can be decreased by using dependencies among the literals.

Abstract. The bounded ILP-consistency problem for function-free Horn
clauses is described as follows. Given a set E+ and E- of function-free
ground Horn clauses and an integer k polynomial in E+ U E-, does there
exist a function-free Horn clause C with no more than k literals such that
C subsumes each element in E+ and C does not subsume any element
in E . It is shown that this problem is E3 complete. We derive some
related results on the complexity of ILP and discuss the usefulness of
such complexity results.

"MUSESCAPE: AN INTERACTIVE CONTENT-AWARE MUSIC BROWSER

ABSTRACT
Advances in hardware performance, network bandwidthand audio
compression have made possible the creation of large personal   
digital music collections. Although, there is a significant body                                   
of work in image and video browsing, there has been little work                                     
that directly addresses the problem of audio and especially music                                      
browsing. In this paper, Musescape, a prototype music browsing                                     
system is described and evaluated. The main characteristics of the                                      
system are automatic configuration based on Computer Audition                                          
techniques and the use of continuous audio-music feedback while                                          
browsing and interacting with the system. The described ideas and                                         
techniques take advantage of the unique characteristics of music                                      
signals. A pilot user study was conducted to explore and evaluate                                      
the proposed user interface. The results indicate that the use of                                  
automatically extracted tempo information reduces browsing time                                         
and that continuous interactive audio feedback is appropriate for                                     
this particular domain.

"SCAN YOUR LIFE: Integrating OCR into your Personal Haystack!

Adam Holt
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

Abstract
I built a self-serve OCR station where anybody can scan in documents at high-speed
{ a public yet private ATM that accepts document deposits of a wider assortment
than just checks. Depending on whether you scan a business card, an article or your
entireling cabinet, CPU-intensive recognition continues after you leave the station,
and you are emailed options for secure web pickup. Users of MIT's Haystack personal
repositories can even do \1-click"" merging of oine literary artifacts into their online
lives.
The paperless pipe dream may never happen, but cheap digital optics and a mundane 
40-year old technology (OCR) are converging to change the game. The mindless
convenience of my $6000 kiosk suggests OCR will become a regulated munition* in
the coming intellectual property and privacy wars. As OCR proliferates into cheap
PDA's, neither publisher nor individual may ever again rely on humanity's oldest
form of copy protection: paper.

"A new approach to clustering

Hanover, NH 03755

Abstract. In this paper we present a new approach for clustering data.
We concentrate on the case where the only available information about
the data is a similarity measure between every pair of elements, and
where the algorithm is expected to handle very noisy data. We make
no assumptions about the size and number of clusters, and the only assumption 
we make about the data itself is that the similarity measure is
on average higher between elements belonging to the same cluster than
between elements belonging to different clusters. The algorithm relies on
very simple operations. The running time is dominated by matrix multi-aplication, 
and in some cases curvetting. We will present experimental
results from various implementations of this method.

"Knowledge Engineering Requirements in Derivational Analogy

Abstract. A major advantage in using a case-based approach to
developing knowledge-based systems is that it can be applied to problems
where a strong domain theory may be difficult to determine. However the
development of case-based reasoning (CBR) systems that set out to support
a sophisticated case adaptation process does require a strong domain model.
The Derivational Analogy (DA) approach to CBR is a case in point. In DA
the case representation contains a trace of the reasoning process involved
in producing the solution for that case. In the adaptation process this
reasoning trace is reinstantiated in the context of the new target case; this
requires a strong domain model and the encoding of problem solving
knowledge. In this paper we analyse this issue using as an example a CBR
system called CoBRA that assists with the modelling tasks in numerical
simulation.

Abstract. Automatically generating high-quality routes using real map
data is difficult for a number of reasons. Real maps rarely contain the
sort of information that is useful for constructing high quality routes. In
addition, the notion of route quality is difficult to define and is likely to
change from person to person. In this sense the automatic construction
of high-quality routes that match the preferences of individuals is an
example of a weak-theory problem, and therefore well suited to a case-based 
approach. In this paper we describe and evaluate a case-based
route planning system that is capable of efficiently generating routes
that reflect the implicit preferences of individual users.

Abstract
The increasing availability of online databases and other information resources in digital libraries and
on the World­Wide Web has created the need for efficient and effective algorithms for selecting databases
to search. A number of techniques have been proposed for query routing or database selection. We
have developed a methodology and metrics that can be used to directly compare competing techniques.
They can also be used to isolate factors that influence the performance of these techniques so that we
can better understand performance issues. In this paper we describe the methodology we have used to
examine the performance of database selection algorithms such as gGlOSS and CORI. In addition we
develop the theory behind a ``random'' database selection algorithm and show how it can be used to help
analyze the behavior of realistic database selection algorithms.

Abstract. We discuss several problems of analogy-driven proof plan
construction which prevent a solution for more difficult target problems
or make a solution very expensive. Some of these problems are due to the
previously assumed fixed order of matching, reformulation, and replay in
case-based reasoning and from a too restricted combination of planning
from first principles with the analogy process. In order to overcome these
problems we suggest to interleave matching and replay as well as case-based 
planning with planning from first principles.
Secondly, the restricted mixture of case-based planning and planning
from first principles in previous systems is generalised to intelligently
employing different planning strategies with the objective to solve more
problems at all and to solve problems more efficiently.

ABSTRACT
Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple
search engines in response to a given query, the problem of
metasearch is to combine these lists in a way which optimizes
the performance of the combination. This problem can be
naturally decomposed into three subproblems: (1) normaliz­ing 
the relevance scores given by the input systems, (2) es­timating 
relevance scores for unretrieved documents, and
(3) combining the newly­acquired scores for each document into one, improved score.
Research on the problem of metasearch has historically concentrated 
on algorithms for combining (normalized) scores.
In this paper, we show that the techniques used for normal­izing 
relevance scores and estimating the relevance scores of
unretrieved documents can have a significant effect on the
overall performance of metasearch. We propose two new
normalization/estimation techniques and demonstrate em­pirically 
that the performance of well known metasearch al­gorithms 
can be significantly improved through their use.

"Specification and Simulation of Statistical Query Algorithms for Eficiency and Noise Tolerance

Javed A. Aslam # Scott E. Decatur +

Cambridge, MA 02138

Abstract
A recent innovation in computational learning theory is
the statistical query (SQ) model. The advantage of specify­ing 
learning algorithms in this model is that SQ algorithms
can be simulated in the PAC model, both in the absence and
in the presence of noise. However, simulations of SQ algo­rithms 
in the PAC model have non­optimal time and sample
complexities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for
specifying statistical query algorithms based on a type of
relative error and provide simulations in the noise­free and
noise­tolerant PAC models which yield eficient algorithms.
Requests for estimates of statistics in this new model take
the form: ``Return an estimate of the statistic within a 1±µ
factor, or return `#', promising that the statistic is less than
#.'' In addition to showing that this is a very natural lan­
guage for specifying learning algorithms, we also show that
this new specification is polynomially equivalent to standard
SQ, and thus, known learnability and hardness results for
statistical query learning are preserved.
We then give highly eficient PAC simulations of relative
error SQ algorithms. We show that the learning algorithms
obtained by simulating eficient relative error SQ algorithms
in both the absence of noise and in the presence of mali­cious 
noise have roughly optimal sample complexity. We
also show that the simulation of eficient relative error SQ
algorithms in the presence of classification noise yield learn­ing 
algorithms at least as eficient as those obtained through
standard methods, and in some cases improved, roughly op­timal 
results are achieved. The sample complexities for all
of these simulations are based on the d# metric which is a
type of relative error metric useful for quantities which are
small or even zero. We show that uniform convergence with
respect to the d# metric yields ``uniform convergence'' with
respect to (µ, #) accuracy.
Finally, while we show that many specific learning al­gorithms 
can be written as highly eficient relative error SQ
algorithms, we also show, in fact, that all SQ algorithms can
be written eficiently by proving general upper bounds on the
complexity of (µ, #) queries as a function of the accuracy
parameter #. As a consequence of this result, we give gen­eral 
upper bounds on the complexity of learning algorithms
achieved through the use of relative error SQ algorithms and
the simulations described above.

Abstract                                                  
The auditive modality, such as speech, signals and natural sounds, is one of the most important ways to          
present and communicate information. However, in computer interfaces the possibilities of auditive modality 
have been almost totally neglected. Usually the audio consists of simple signals (beeps and clicks)       
or background music. The present paper outlines some of the possibilities in presenting and managing             
information in computers by using audio from the perspective of the semiotic theory of signs. Auditive           
interfaces can be especially useful for people with visual or kinaesthetic disabilities, as well as in places    
and with devices when the visual-kinaesthetic using of the machine is difficult, for example while on the        
move or with small display devices.

Abstract. The issue of quality control has become increasingly impor­tant 
as more online databases are integrated into digital libraries. This
can have a dramatic effect on the search effectiveness of an online sys­tem. 
Authority work, the need to discover and reconcile variant forms
of strings in bibliographic entries, will become more difficult. Spelling
variants, misspellings, translation and transliteration differences all in­crease 
the difficulty of retrieving information. This paper is a case study
of our efforts to automate the creation of an authority file for authors' in­stitutional 
affiliations in the Astrophysics Data System. The techniques
surveyed here for the detection and categorization of variant forms have
broader applicability and may be used to help automate authority work
for other bibliographic fields.

"Solution-Relevant Abstractions Constrain Retrieval and Adaptation

Abstract. Two major problems in case-based reasoning are the efficient
and justified retrieval of source cases and the adaptation of retrieved
solutions to the conditions of the target. For analogical theorem proving
by induction, we describe how a solution-relevant abstraction can restrict
the retrieval of source cases and the mapping from the source problem to
the target problem and how it can determine reformulations that further
adapt the source solution.

"Personify a toolkit for perceptually meaningful sonification

Stephen Barrass

ABSTRACT
People naturally use their hearing to obtain information to support their everyday activities. Sonification is the application
of hearing to support computer based information processing tasks where numerical or other data replaces the
environment as a source of sounds. Turning numbers into sounds is easy with current music technology. But creating
intuitive and informative sonification mappings is not. The auditory display of scientific data requires consideration of the
task at hand, an understanding of data characteristics, and an expert knowledge of psychoacoustics. The display designer
must depend on experience, a few heuristic guidelines, patience and luck - this is why successful examples are rare.
Personify is a suite of software tools which enable a non-expert to quickly and easily craft meaningful and effective
sonifications. Interaction with these tools is focused on what a person hears, rather than on how a device makes sounds.
The toolkit provides a systematic framework which consists of a number of data sensitive mapping techniques based on a
perceptually linearised sound space. The user is able to select sequences in the sound space using geometric paths such as
lines, spirals and planes. Constrained guidance embodies the expert knowledge in the system.
This paper will describe the Personify toolkit, its purpose, theoretical foundation, the component tools, and the multimedia
user interface.

"Separating the Power of Monotone Span Programs over Different Fields

Amos Beimel  Enav Weinreb y

Abstract
Monotone span programs are a linear­algebraic model
of computation. They are equivalent to linear secret shar­ing 
schemes and have various applications in cryptogra­phy 
and complexity. A fundamental question is how the
choice of the field in which the algebraic operations are
performed effects the power of the span program. In this
paper we prove that the power of monotone span programs
over finite fields of different characteristics is incompara­ble; 
we show a super­polynomial separation between any
two fields with different characteristics, answering an open
problem of Pudl ak and Sgall 1998. Using this result we
prove a super­polynomial lower bound for monotone span
programs for a function in uniform NC 2 (and therefore
in P), answering an open problem of Babai, Wigderson,
and G al 1999. (All previous lower bounds for monotone
span programs were for functions not known to be in P.) Fi­nally, 
we show that quasi­linear schemes, a generalization
of linear secret sharing schemes introduced in Beimel and
Ishai 2001, are stronger than linear secret sharing schemes.
In particular, this proves, without any assumptions, that
non­linear secret sharing schemes are more efficient than
linear secret sharing schemes.

Abstract. This paper continues a previous work using stochastic heuristics 
to extract and exploit knowledge with no size restrictions, with polynomial 
complexity.
A simplified relational framework is described; within this framework,
one basic learning component, the generalization operator, is reconsidered.
Stochastic heuristics are combined with Plotkins least general generalization 
to derive a stochastic generalization operator and a simple
stochastic similarity function with controllable complexity.
Preliminary experiments on the well-studied mutagenesis problem (regression-friendly 
and regression-unfriendly datasets) demonstrate the potential 
and the limitations of this similarity.

Abstract
This paper describes an Electronic Travel Aid device,
that may enable blind individuals to see the world with
theirears. Awearable prototype will be assembled using
low-cost hardware: earphones, sunglasses tted with two
micro cameras, anda palmtop computer. The system, which
currently run sona desktopccomputer, is able to detect the
light spot produced by a laser pointer, compute its angular 
position and depth, and generate a corresponding sound
providing the auditory cues for the perception of the position
and distance of the pointed surface patch. It permits
differents on ication modes that can be chosen by drawing,
with the laser pointer, a predened stroke which will be recognized 
by a Hidden Markov Model. In this way the blind
person can use a common pointer as a replacement of the
can e and will interact with the device by using a exible and
natural sketch based interface.

Abstract This paper discusses some key issues in using case based methods to solve
large constraint satisfaction problems. The problem addressed here is characterised by
the large cardinality of the constraint tables. The aim is to reduce the amount of
consistency checking carried out by database queries. We have addressed issues
concerning the similarity measurement, adaptation/repair control in terms of conflict
ordering strategies, the quality of the case base and issues concerning backtracking
strategies. The results presented in this paper indicate an approach for improving case
based methods in solving large constraint satisfaction problems.

Abstract. Lessons learned processes, and software systems that support
them, have been developed by many organizations (e.g., all USA
military branches, NASA, several Department of Energy organizations,
the Construction Industry Institute). Their purpose is to promote the
dissemination of knowledge gained from the experiences of an
organizations employees. Unfortunately, lessons learned systems are
usually ineffective because they invariably introduce new processes
when, instead, they should be embedded into the processes that they are
meant to improve. We developed an embedded case-based approach for
lesson dissemination and reuse that brings lessons to the attention of
users rather than requiring them to fetch lessons from a standalone
software tool. We demonstrate this active lessons delivery architecture
in the context of HICAP, a decision support tool for plan authoring. We
also show the potential of active lessons delivery to increase plan
quality for a new travel domain.

Abstract. Recommendations by salespeople are always based on knowledge 
about the products and expertise about your tastes, preferences, interests 
and behavior in the shop. In an attempt to model the behavior of
salespeople, AI research has been focussed on the so called recommender
agents. Such agents draw on previous results from machine learning and
other advances in AI technology to develop user models and to anticipate 
and predict user preferences. In this paper we introduce a new
approach to recommendation, based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR).
CBR is a paradigm for learning and reasoning through experience, as
salesmen do. We present a user model based on cases in which we try
to capture both explicit interests (the user is asked for information) and
implicit interests (captured from user interaction) of a user on a given
item. Retrieval is based on a similarity function that is constantly tuned
according to the user model. Moreover, in order to cope with the utility
problem that current CBR system suffer from, our approach includes a
forgetting mechanism (the drift attribute) that can be extended to other
applications beyond e-commerce.

"Induction of Slovene Nominal Paradigms

Department of Intelligent Systems, Jozef Stefan Institute
Jamova 39, SI 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia


Abstract. The paper presents results of using FOIDL, an inductive logic
programming system, to learn the inflectional paradigms of Slovene nouns.
FOIDL learns first-order decision lists, defined as ordered list of clauses; it
has been previously tested on the problem of inducing rules for forming
the past tense of English verbs. Slovene, unlike English, has rich inflectional 
morphology, and the paper reports the result of applying FOIDL
over a large lexicon of Slovene word-forms to induce rules for the synthesis 
and analysis of the full inflectional paradigms of Slovene nouns.

Abstract. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for transformational
adaptation based on detecting a solutions incompatibility regarding the new
problem situation and trying to overcome the incompatibility in an iterative
manner. By incompatibility, we mean a state for which the required objectives
are not satisfied due to any change in the status of the constraints. Based upon
this approach, we have proposed a framework for redesigning an existing
system under new constraints. To show the capability of this framework, a
software prototype was developed that it is capable of redesigning an existing
digital circuit under presence of new constraints, e.g. type of gates, power
dissipation, fan in/out, gate prices and so on.

Abstract. We present a case adaptation method that employs ideas from the field of
genetic algorithms. Two types of adaptations, case combination and case mutation, are
used to evolve variations on the contents of retrieved cases until a satisfactory solution is
found for a new specified problem. A solution is satisfactory if it matches the specitied
requirements and does not violate any constraints imposed by the domain of
applicability. We have implemented our ideas in a computational system called
GENCAD, applied to the layout design of residences such that they conform to the
principles of feng shui, the Chinese art of placement. This implementation allows us to
evaluate the use of GAs for case adaptation in CBR. Experimental results show the role
of representation and constraints.

Extraction Pattern Contexts

Abstract
This paper describes a bootstrapping al­gorithm called Basilisk that learns high­
quality semantic lexicons for multiple cate­gories. Basilisk begins with an unannotated
corpus and seed words for each semantic
category, which are then bootstrapped to
learn new words for each category. Basilisk
hypothesizes the semantic class of a word
based on collective information over a large
body of extraction pattern contexts. We
evaluate Basilisk on six semantic categories.
The semantic lexicons produced by Basilisk
have higher precision than those produced
by previous techniques, with several cate­gories showing substantial improvement.

Abstract. This paper reports the results of an inductive logic programming 
(ILP) application to solve shogi or Japanese chess mating problems, 
which are puzzles using shogi rules. The problems can be solved
by heuristic search of AND-OR trees. We propose a method of using the
ILP technique to generate heuristic functions, which are automatically
tuned according to the confidence of the knowledge induced by ILP. Experiments 
show that the method prunes search space compared with a
naive search.

Abstract. Bayesian Case Reconstruction (BCR) is a case-based technique that
broadens the coverage of a case library by sampling and recombining pieces of
existing cases to construct a large set of plausible cases. It employs a Bayesian 
Belief Network to evaluate whether implicit dependencies within the original 
cases have been maintained. The belief network is constructed from the
experts limited understanding of the domain theory combined with the data
available in the case library. The cases are the primary reasoning vehicle. The
belief network leverages the available domain model to help evaluate whether
the plausible cases have maintained the necessary internal context. BCR is
applied to the design of screening experiments for Macromolecular Crystallization 
in the Probabilistic Screen Design program. We describe BCR and provide 
an empirical comparison of the Probabilistic Screen Design program
against the current practice in Macromolecular Crystallization.

"Integrated Case-Based Building Design

Kefeng Hua, Ian Smith and Boi Faltings

Summary

A building design task can be viewed according to many different abstractions. For example,
an architect views a building as a collection of spaces with particular properties, while a civil
engineer might consider it to be a structure made up of load-bearing elements. In order to produce
a workable design, it is important to be able to combine these different viewpoints. Difficulties
associated with combining viewpoints lead to what we term the integration problem. The case-based 
design (CBD) methodology presented in this paper provides an opportunity to model the
intentions of several professions and trades using cases of previous good designs. Therefore,
CBD provides pre-formulated solutions to integration problems. We describe a prototype design
system, CADRE, which applies CBD to several examples of building design.

Abstract. This paper describes an application of case-based reasoning in the field of health care
planning. The process is modelled in the FLORENCE expert system, an experimental prototype
which models the reasoning of an expert clinician in advising on the three basic planning tasks of
diagnosis, prognosis and prescription within a nursing domain. We have developed an empirical
approach. Both role-based and caae-based reasoning are used where appropriate. It has been found
that caae-based reasoning is especially appropriate to Situations where decisions must be made about
the progress of cases over time.

"Theory Completion Using Inverse Entailment

Abstract. The main real-world applications of Inductive Logic 
Programming (ILP) to date involve the Observation Predicate Learning
(OPL) assumption, in which both the examples and hypotheses define
the same predicate. However, in both scientific discovery and language
learning potential applications exist in which OPL does not hold. OPL is
ingrained within the theory and performance testing of Machine 
Learning. A general ILP technique called Theory Completion using Inverse
Entailment (TCIE) is introduced which is applicable to non-OPL 
applications. TCIE is based on inverse entailment and is closely allied to
abductive inference. The implementation of TCIE within Progol5.0 is
described. The implementation uses contra-positives in a similar way to
Stickels Prolog Technology Theorem Prover. Progol5.0 is tested on two
different data-sets. The first dataset involves a grammar which 
translates numbers to their representation in English. The second dataset
involves hypothesising the function of unknown genes within a network
of metabolic pathways. On both datasets near complete recovery of 
performance is achieved after relearning when randomly chosen portions of
background knowledge are removed. Progol5.0s running times for 
experiments in this paper were typically under 6 seconds on a standard laptop
PC.

Abstract. Generalized cases are cases that cover a subspace rather than
a point in the problem-solution space. Generalized cases can be represented 
by a set of constraints over the case attributes. For such representations, 
the similarity assessment between a point query and generalized
cases is a difficult problem that is addressed in this paper. The task is
to find the distance (or the related similarity) between the point query
and the closest point of the area covered by the generalized cases, with
respect to some given similarity measure. We formulate this problem as a
mathematical optimization problem and we propose a new cutting plane
method which enables us to rank generalized cases according to their
distance to the query.

"A Unified Model for Metasearch and the Efficient Evaluation of Retrieval Systems via the Hedge Algorithm

Javed A. Aslam, Virgiliu Pavlu, Robert Savell

{jaa,virgilpavlu,rsavell}@cs.dartmouth.edu

ABSTRACT
We present a unified framework for simultaneously solving
both the pooling problem (the construction of eficient doc­ument 
pools for the evaluation of retrieval systems) and
metasearch (the fusion of ranked lists returned by retrieval
systems in order to increase performance). The implemen­tation 
is based on the Hedge algorithm for online learning,
which has the advantage of convergence to bounded error
rates approaching the performance of the best linear com­bination 
of the underlying systems. The choice of a loss
function closely related to the average precision measure of
system performance ensures that the judged document set
performs well, both in constructing a metasearch list and
as a pool for the accurate evaluation of retrieval systems.
Our experimental results on TREC data demonstrate excel­lent 
performance in all measures---evaluation of systems, re­trieval 
of relevant documents, and generation of metasearch
lists.

Abstract. A novel first order clustering system, called C 0.5, is presented. 
It inherits its logical decision tree formalism from the TILDE
system, but instead of using class information to guide the search, it
employs the principles of instance based learning in order to perform
clustering. Various experiments are discussed, which show the promise
of the approach.

Abstract. Designers are limited in exploiting a catalog knowledge base of
design cases because they may be unable to articulate what they are looking for,
or may be unaware that potentially useful catalog examples exist. KID
(Knowing-In-Design), a domain-oriented, knowledge-based design environment 
for kitchen floor plan design, integrates the use of the catalog-base with its
design tools. The information given through KIDSPECIFICATION (for specifying
a design requirement) and KIDCONSTRUCTION (for graphically constructing a
floor plan) provides representations of the designers task at hand, and recorded
design rationale in its argnmentation-base is used to infer the relevance of
catalog examples to the task at hand. The CASE-DELIVERER component orders
catalog examples according to the partial specification, and the
CATALOGEXPLORER subsystem allows designers to explore further the catalog
space in terms of the task at hand. The study and assessment of the
mechanisms have revealed that delivered cases helped designers reframe both a
problem and a solution, and have encouraged designers to articulate a new
portion of design knowledge, which addresses the knowledge acquisition
problem.

Abstract
We present a method for displaying time-varying       
probabilistic information to users using an asynchronous granular 
synthesis technique. We extend the basic synthesis technique 
to include distribution over waveform source, spatial position,  
pitch and time inside waveforms. To enhance the synthesis in     
interactive contexts, we quicken the display by integrating    
predictions of user behaviour into the sonification. This includes
summing the derivatives of the distribution during exploration                                                                
of static densities, and using Monte-Carlo sampling to predict                                                                
future user states in nonlinear dynamic systems. These techniques                                                             
can be used to improve user performance in continuous control                                                                 
systems and in the interactive exploration of high dimensional   
spaces. This technique provides feedback from users potential    
goals, and their progress toward achieving them; modulating                                                                   
the feedback with quickening can help shape the users actions                                                                 
toward achieving these goals. We have applied these techniques 
a simple nonlinear control problem as well as to the sonification                                                              
of on-line probabilistic gesture recognition. We are applying                                                                 
these displays to mobile, gestural interfaces, where visual display                                                           
is often impractical. The granular synthesis approach is theoretically 
elegant and easily applied in contexts where dynamic 
probabilistic displays are required.

Abstract. Case-based problem-solving systems reason and learn from
experiences, building up case libraries of problems and solutions to guide
future reasoning. The expected benefits of this learning process depend
on two types of regularity: (1) problem-solution regularity, the relationship 
between problem-to-problem and solution-to-solution similarity measures 
that assures that solutions to similar prior problems are a useful
starting point for solving similar current problems, and (2) problem-distribution 
regularity, the relationship between old and new problems
that assures that the case library will contain cases similar to the new
problems it encounters. Unfortunately, these types of regularity are not
assured. Even in contexts for which initial regularity is sufficient, problems 
may arise if a systems users, tasks, or external environment change
over time. This paper defines criteria for assessing the two types of regularity, 
discusses how the definitions may be used to assess the need
for case-base maintenance, and suggests maintenance approaches for responding 
to those needs. In particular, it discusses the role of analysis of
performance over time in responding to environmental changes.

Abstract.   
This paper describes the design of an Electronic Travel Aid        
device, that will enable blind individuals to see the world with their        
ears. A wearable protot ype will be assembled using low-cost hardware:        
earphones, sunglasses tted with two CMOS micro cameras, and a palmtop 
computer. Curren tly, the system is able to detect the light spot produced
by a laser pointer, compute its angular position and depth, and          
generate a correspondent sound providing the auditory cues for the perception
of the position and distance of the pointed surface. In this way       
the blind person can use a common pointer as a replacement of the cane.

ABSTRACT
Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) simulation is a popular computational 
tool for making inferences from complex, high-dimensional probability 
densities. Given a particular target densityp,
idea behind this technique is to simulate a Markov chain that has                                                            
pas its stationary distribution. To be successful, the chain needs                                                           
to be run long enough so that the distribution of the current draw                                                           
is close to the target density. Unfortunately, very few diagnostic                                                           
tools exist to monitor characteristics of the chain.                                                                         
   In this paper, we present a new approach to render sonifications 
of McMC simulations. The proposed method consists of       
several auditory streams which provide information about the behavior 
of the Markov chain. In particular, we focus on uncovering modes in 
the target density function. In addition to mon-                                                              
itoring, we have found our sonication to be an effective means                                                              
for understanding the structure of high-dimensional densities. We                                                            
have also applied our method to the exploratory analysis of high-dimensional 
data sets. In this case, we take as our targpeta non-parametric 
density estimate obtained from the data. In this paper,                                                           
we present a detailed description of our sonification design and illustrate 
its performance on test cases consisting of both synthetic                                                          
and real-world data sets. Sound examples are also given.

reuse in CBR systems for configuration tasks. We discuss the
relation of constructive adaptation (CA) with other reuse approaches
and we define CA as a search process in the space of solutions where
cases are used in two main phases: hypotheses generation and hypotheses 
ordering. Later, three different CBR systems using CA for reuse are
analyzed: configuring gas treatment plants, generating expressive musical 
phrases, and configuring component-based software applications.
After the three analyses, constructive adaptation is discussed in detail
and some conclusions are drawn to close the paper.

Abstract. We present and evaluate two methods for improving the performance 
of ILP systems. One of them is discretization of numerical attributes, 
based on Fayyad and Iranis text [9], but adapted and extended
in such a way that it can cope with some aspects of discretization that
only occur in relational learning problems (when indeterminate literals
occur). The second technique is lookahead. It is a well-known problem in
ILP that a learner cannot always assess the quality of a refinement without 
knowing which refinements will be enabled afterwards, i.e. without
looking ahead in the refinement lattice. We present a simple method for
specifying when lookahead is to be used, and what kind of lookahead is
interesting. Both the discretization and lookahead techniques are evaluated 
experimentally. The results show that both techniques improve the
quality of the induced theory, while computational costs are acceptable.

"Distances and Limits on Herbrand Interpretations

Abstract. A notion of distances between Herbrand interpretations enables 
us to measure how good a certain program, learned from examples,
approximates some target program. The distance introduced in [10] has
the disadvantage that it does not fit the notion of identification in the
limit . We use a distance defined by a level mapping [5] to overcome this
problem, and study in particular the mapping Tn induced by a definite
program H on the metric space. Continuity of Tn holds under certain
conditions, and we give a concrete level mapping that satisfies these conditions, 
based on [10]. This allows us to prove the existence of fixed points
without using the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.

"Integrating Structural Search Capabilities Into Project Haystack

Abstract
In this thesis, we have designed and implemented a system for performing structural
searched in Haystack. The Haystack data model is semi­structured, and the chal­
lenge of this project was to develop a system that performs database­like queries on
semistructured data using current relational database technologies. To achieve this
goal, we have designed a database schema that would allow us to store our data
model. We have specified the format in which the user can enter database queries
and implemented procedures that translate user queries into SQL. We have designed
a way to integrate structural search with text search in Haystack and have outlined
ideas on how database queries can be used for machine learning.

SUMMARY
In this paper we describe a new focus and context visualization
technique called multimodal focus and context.   
This technique uses a hybrid visual and spatialized audio  
display space to overcome the limited visual displays of   
mobile devices.  We demonstrate the technique by applying 
it to maps of theme parks.

"Improving Part of Speech Disambiguation Rules by Adding Linguistic Knowledge

Abstract. This paper reports the ongoing work of producing a state of
the art part of speech tagger for unedited Swedish text. Rules eliminating 
faulty tags have been induced using Progol. In previously reported
experiments, almost no linguistically motivated background knowledge
was used [5, 8]. Still, the result was rather promising (recall 97.7%, with a
pending average ambiguity of 1.13 tags/word). Compared to the previous
study, a much richer, more linguistically motivated, background knowledge 
has been supplied, consisting of examples of noun phrases, verb
chains, auxiliary verbs, and sets of part of speech categories. The aim
has been to create the background knowledge rapidly, without laborious
hand-coding of linguistic knowledge. In addition to the new background
knowledge, new, more expressive rule types have been induced for two
part of speech categories and compared to the corresponding rules of the
previous bottom-line experiment. The new rules perform considerably
better, with a recall of 99.4% for the new rules, compared to 97.6% for
the old rules. Precision was slightly better for the new rules.

Abstract:	We present a framework for assessing knowledge management 
(KM) technology that has been validated by using more than
twenty well-known tools. Based on a commercial case-based reasoning
(CBR) tool, the technology descriptions have been made available in
the KM-PEB experience base over the World Wide Web. KM researchers 
as well as KM tool developers and/or users can search for similar
descriptions and/or contribute their own ones. We think that the KM
and CBR communities can benefit very much from each other, and we
hope that this paper - and its underlying application KM-PEB - supports
the (already started) collaboration of these communities in a constructive way.

ABSTRACT
There is a huge amount of audio data available that is
compressed using the MPEG audio compression standard.
Sound analysis is based on the computation of short time
feature vectors that describe the instantaneous spectral con­tent 
of the sound. An interesting possibility is the calcu­lation 
of features during the decompression process. Since
the bulk of the feature calculation is performed during the
encoding stage this process has a significant performance
advantage if the available data is compressed. Combining
decoding and analysis in one stage is also very important
for audio streaming applications.
In this paper, we describe the calculation of features
directly from MPEG audio compressed data. Two of the
basic processes of analyzing sound are: segmentation and
classification. To illustrate the effectiveness of the calcu­lated 
features we have implemented two case studies: a
general audio segmentation algorithm and a Music/Speech
classifier . Experimental data is provided to show that the
results obtained are comparable with sound analysis algo­rithms 
working directly with audio samples.

"KBS Maintenance as Learning Two-Tiered Domain Representation *

Abstract. The paper deals with the problem of improving problem-solving 
behavior of traditional KBS in the course of its real operation
which is a part of the maintenance task. The solution of the problem is
searched in integration of the KBS with a specially designed case-based
reasoning module used for correcting solutions produced by the KBS.
Special attention is paid to the methods of case matching and reconciling 
conflicts between CBR and RBR. The proposed solution for both
problems is based on treating the maintenance task as a problem for
learning two-tiered domain representation. From this view point rules
form the first domain tier reflecting existing strong patterns in the representation 
of domain concepts, while the second tier is formed by the
newly solved cases along with a special domain-dependent procedure for
case matching. The main ideas of the approach are illustrated by the
results of some experiments with the experimental system CoRCase.

A problem with mobile computing devices is the output of dynamic information because their         
screens are small. This paper describes an experiment to investigate the use of non-speech sounds  
to present dynamic information without using visual display space. Results showed that non-speech 
sound could be used in a simple share-dealing scenario to present a sound graph of share  
prices. This allowed participants to reduce the workload they had to invest in share-price monitoring 
as they could listen to the graph whilst they worked in a share accumulation window.

"Static and Dynamic Information Organization with Star Clusters

Abstract
In this paper we present a system for static and dy­
namic information organization and show our evaluations
of this system on TREC data. We introduce the off­line
and on­line star clustering algorithms for information or­
ganization. Our evaluation experiments show that the offline 
star algorithm outperforms the single link and average
link clustering algorithms. Since the star algorithm is also
highly e#cient and simple to implement, we advocate its
use for tasks that require clustering, such as information
organization, browsing, filtering, routing, topic tracking,
and new topic detection.

We have designed tetravelent miniantibodies assembling in the periplasm of       
Escherichia coli They are based on single-chain Fv fragments, connected via
a exible hinge to an amphipathic helix which tetramerizes the molecule. The     
amphipathic helix is derived from the coiled coil helix of the transcription     
factor GCN4, in which all hydrophobic       a ositions of every heptad repeat    
have been exchanged to leucine and all dpositions to isoleucine. Gel ltration   
shows tetramer assembly of the miniantibody even at low concentrations. As       
expected, the functional affinity (avidity) of the tetravalent miniantibody is    
higher in ELISA and BIAcore measurements than that of the bivalent               
onstruct and the gain is dependent on surface epitope density.

Abstract. From the point of view of computational linguistics, Hungarian 
is a difficult language due to its complex grammar and rich morphology. 
This means that even a common task such as part-of-speech tagging
presents a new challenge for learning when looked at for the Hungarian
language, especially given the fact that this language has fairly free word
order. In this paper we therefore present a case study designed to illustrate 
the potential and limits of current ILP and non-ILP algorithms
on the Hungarian POS-tagging task. We have selected the popular C4.5
and Progol systems as propositional and ILP representatives, adding experiments 
with our own methods AGLEARN, a C4.5 preprocessor based
on attribute grammars, and the ILP approaches PHM and RIBL. The
systems were compared on the Hungarian version of the multilingual
morphosyntactically annotated MULTEXT-East TELRJ corpus which
consists of about 100.000 tokens. Experimental results indicate that Hungarian 
POS-tagging is indeed a challenging task for learning algorithms,
that even simple background knowledge leads to large differences in accuracy, 
and that instance-based methods are promising approaches to
POS tagging also for Hungarian. The paper also includes experiments
with some different cascade connections of the taggers.

This paper presents a study of an auditory version of the game Towers of Hanoi. The goal of this study was to investigate 
the nature of continuos presentation and what this could mean when implementing auditory direct manipulation.                
We also wanted to find out if it was possible to make an auditory interface that met the requirements of a direct manipulation 
interface. The results showed that it was indeed possible to implement auditory direct manipulation, but 
using Towers of Hanoi as the underlying model restricted the possibilities of scaling the auditory space. The results also          
showed that having a limited set of objects, the nature of continuos presentation was not as important as how to interact         
with the auditory space.

ABSTRACT
The use of sonification as a means of representing and          
analysing data has become a growing field of research in recent                                                             
years and as such has become a far more accepted means of                                                                   
working with data. Existing work carried out as part of this    
research has focused primarily on the sonification of                                                                       
DNA/RNA sequences and their subsequent protein structures       
for the purposes of analysis. This sonification work raised many
questions as regards the need for sequences to be set to music in                                                           
a standard manner so that different strands could be analysed by
comparison, and hence the orchestration and instrumentation     
used became of great importance.                                                                                            
The basic principles of sonification can be rapidly extended to 
include many different data elements within a single rendering,                                                             
and thus the importance of orchestration grows accordingly.     
Existing work on the use of rhythmic parsing within a                                                                       
sonification had suggested that far more information could be                                                               
represented when orchestrated in a rhythmic manner than when                                                                
simply reconstituted in single musical block. The principle was                                                             
further extended to include the allocation specific instruments                                                             
and pitches within rhythmic patterns so that each sonic event                                                               
would convey the data it was intended to represent. To this end                                                             
a fictional database of employees in a company was created as a                                                             
means of developing the principles required for more effective                                                              
sonification through orchestration.                                                                                         
The employee database was intended as a means of using a                                                                    
straightforward data set to analyse the effect of basic changes in                                                          
instrumentation and orchestration rather than the data itself. The                                                          
allocation of chord intervals or melodies to different data                                                                 
elements allowed the data to be represented in different ways at 
output in order that these differences would eventually highlight                                                           
some form of framework for effective sonification of data sets  
with multiple elements.

Abstract. The adaptation step is central in case-based reasoning
(CBR), because it conditions the obtaining of a solution to a problem.
This step is difficult from the knowledge acquisition and engineering
points of view. We propose a knowledge level analysis of the adaptation
step in CBR using the reasoning task concept. Our proposal is based on
the study of several CBR systems for complex applications which imply 
the adaptation task. Three of them are presented to illustrate our
analysis. We sketch from this study a generic model of the adaptation
process using the task concept. This model is in conformity with other
CBR formal models.

Abstract
This paper applies an existing query trans­lation 
method to cross­language patent re­trieval. 
In our method, multiple dictionar­ies 
are used to derive all possible transla­tions 
for an input query, and collocational
statistics are used to resolve translation am­biguity. 
We used Japanese/English parallel
patent abstracts to perform comparative exper­iments, 
where our method outperformed a sim­ple 
dictionary-­based query translation method,
and achieved 76% of monolingual retrieval in
terms of average precision.

"Information Extraction as a Basis for High­Precision Text Classification

Abstract
We describe an approach to text classification that represents a compromise be­
tween traditional word­based techniques and in­depth natural language processing.
Our approach uses a natural language processing task called information extraction
as a basis for high­precision text classification. We present three algorithms that use
varying amounts of extracted information to classify texts. The relevancy signatures
algorithm uses linguistic phrases, the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm uses
phrases and local context, and the case­based text classification algorithm uses larger
pieces of context. Relevant phrases and contexts are acquired automatically using a
training corpus. We evaluate the algorithms on the basis of two test sets from the
MUC­4 corpus. All three algorithms achieved high precision on both test sets, with
the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm and the case­based algorithm reaching
100% precision with over 60% recall on one set. In addition, we compare the algorithms
on a larger collection of 1700 texts and describe an automated method for empirically
deriving appropriate threshold values. The results suggest that information extraction
techniques can support high­precision text classification and, in general, using more
extracted information improves performance. As a practical matter, we also explain
how the text classification system can be easily ported across domains.

Abstract. This paper describes a parallel version of Progol based on
MGTP which is a theorem prover employing bottom-up inference suitable 
for parallel implementation. Hypothesis formation in Progol, which
is performed by top-down computation with Prolog in the sequential implementation, 
will be performed more efficiently by bottom-up compu-
tation with MGTP in the new implementation. For the Progols general-to-specific 
search for hypotheses though the subsumption lattice, we
developed a new way of calculating a heuristic function for the A*-like
algorithm, which was also implemented with MGTP. Since MGTP already has 
very efficient parallel implementations on parallel inference
machines, an efficient implementation of parallel-Progol will readily be
realized as well.

ABSTRACT
Musical genres are categorical descriptions that are used to
describe music. They are commonly used to structure the
increasing amounts of music available in digital form on the
Web and are important for music information retrieval.
Genre categorization for audio has traditionally been
performed manually. A particular musical genre is
characterized by statistical properties related to the
instrumentation, rhythmic structure and form of its
members. In this work, algorithms for the automatic genre
categorization of audio signals are described. More
specifically, we propose a set of features for representing
texture and instrumentation. In addition a novel set of
features for representing rhythmic structure and strength is
proposed. The performance of those feature sets has been
evaluated by training statistical pattern recognition
classifiers using real world audio collections. Based on the
automatic hierarchical genre classification two graphical
user interfaces for browsing and interacting with large
audio collections have been developed.

Abstract. In this paper the problem of induction of clausal theories
through a search space consisting of theories is studied. We order the
search space by an extension of O-subsumption for theories, and find a
least generalization and a greatest specialization of theories. A most 
specific theory is introduced, and we develop a refinement operator bounded
by this theory.

Abstract. Most traditional CBR systems are passive in nature, adopting 
an advisor role in which a user manually consults the system. In this
paper, we propose a system architecture and algorithm for transforming
a passive interactive CBR system into an active, autonomous CBR system. 
Our approach is based on the idea that cases in a CBR system can
be used to model hypotheses in a situation assessment application, where
case attributes can be considered as questions or information tasks to be
performed on multiple information sources. Under this model, we can use
the CBR system to continually generate tasks that are planned for and
executed based on information sources such as databases, the Internet
or the user herself. The advantage of the system is that the majority
of trivial or repeated questions to information sources can be done autonomously 
through information gathering techniques, and human users
are only asked a small number of necessary questions by the system.
We demonstrate the application of our approach to an equipment diagnosis 
domain. We show that the system integrates CBR retrieval with
hierarchical query planning, optimization and execution.

"Using ILP to Improve Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

Mark Reid and Malcolm Ryan

School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales
Sydney 2052, Australia
{mreid,malcolmr}@cse.unsw.edu.au



Abstract. Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been proposed as a
solution to the problem of scaling up reinforcement learning. The RL-TOPs 
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning System is an implementation 
of this proposal which structures an agents sensors and actions into
various levels of representation and control. Disparity between levels of
representation means actions can be misused by the planning algorithm
in the system. This paper reports on how JLP was used to bridge these
representation gaps and shows empirically how this improved the systems 
performance. Also discussed are some of the problems encountered
when using an ILP system in what is inherently a noisy and incremental
domain.

"COMPUTING FUNCTIONS OF A SHARED SECRET 

AMOS BEIMEL  , MIKE BURMESTER y , YVO DESMEDT z , AND EYAL KUSHILEVITZ x

Abstract. In this work we introduce and study threshold (t-out-of-n) secret sharing schemes
for families of functions F . Such schemes allow any set of at least t parties to compute privately the
value f(s) of a (previously distributed) secret s, for any f 2 F . Smaller sets of players get no more
information about the secret than what follows from the value f(s). The goal is to make the shares
as short as possible. Results are obtained for two different settings: we study the case when the
evaluation is done on a broadcast channel without interaction; and we examine what can be gained
by allowing evaluations to be done interactively via private channels.

Abstract. A similarity framework for definitional representations is presented. 
Similarity assessment is based on the computation and estimation
of structural relationships (connections) among definitions. The framework 
is general enough to capture many different types of similarity measures: 
ordinal and cardinal measures, asymmetric measures, and measures 
between any number of objects. By definition, the similarity measures 
retrieve the cases that need the least adaptation.

Abstract                                                                                                     
The majority of work in auditory user interfaces has focused on adding auditory cues            
to a visual interface. This paper presents work in designing interactive auditory-only         
interfaces wher e the design of the interface is driven by a challenging task --                
providing access to graphical user interfaces for people who are blind. This task              
requires that the auditory-only interface must be able to provide the same                     
functionality supported by a graphical user interface. A prototype system called     
Mercator is described as well as some of the design strategies for Mercators auditory       
interfaces. The results from a small user study are also presented with a concluding          
discussion on futur e research efforts.

Abstract. This paper describes a quantitative similarity metric and its
contribution to achieve original plan solutions. This similarity metric is used
by an iterative process of piece retrieval from structured plan cases. Within
our approach plan cases are tree-like networks of pieces (goals and actions).
These case pieces are ill-related each other by links (explanations). These
links may be classified as hierarchical or temporal, antecedent or consequent,
and explicit or implicit. Besides links, each case piece has also information
about its properties (the attributes-value pairs), its hierarchical and temporal
position in the case (the address), and about its constraints in the relationship
with others (the constraints). The similarity metric computes a similarity
value between two case pieces taking into account similarities between these
case pieces information types. Each time a problem is proposed, different
weights are given to some of those similarities, with the aim of solving it
with an original solution. This similarity metric is used by the system
INSPIRER (ImagiNation taking as Source Past and Imperfectly REalated
Reasonings). We illustrate the role of the similarity metric in the creativity of
solutions, focusing specially their originality, with the presentation of the
experimental results obtained in the musical composition domain, which is
considered by us as a planning domain.

Abstract. Most of machine learning is concerned with learning a single 
concept from a sequence of examples. In repeat learning the teacher
chooses a series of related concepts randomly and independently from a
distribution D A finite sequence of examples is provided for each concept 
in the series. The learner does not initially know V, but progressively
updates a posterior estimation of V as the series progresses. This paper
considers predicate invention within Inductive Logic Programming as a
mechanism for updating the learners estimation of V. A new predicate
invention mechanism implemented in Progol4.4 is used in repeat learning
experiments within a chess domain. The results indicate that significant
performance increases can be achieved. The paper develops a Bayesian
framework and demonstrates initial theoretical results for repeat learning.

Abstract
We show that two simple constraints, when
applied to short user queries (on the order of
5--10 words) can yield precision scores com­parable 
to or better than those achieved using
long queries (50--85 words) at low document
cutoff levels. These constraints are meant to
detect documents that have subtopic passages
that includes the most important components
of the query. The constraints are: (i) a sim­ple 
Boolean constraint which requires the user
to specify the query as a list of topics; this
list is converted into a conjunct of disjuncts
by the system, and (ii) a subtopic­sized prox­imity 
constraint imposed over the Boolean con­straint. 
The vector space model is used to rank
the documents that satisfy both constraints. Ex­periments 
run over 45 TREC queries show sig­nificant, 
almost consistent improvements over
rankings that use no constraints. These results
have important ramifications for interactive sys­tems 
intended for casual users, such as those
searching on the World Wide Web.

"Refining Complete Hypotheses in ILP

Ivan Bratko


University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Sc.
Trzaska 25, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia
bratko@fri.uni-lj.si



Abstract. Most ILP systems employ the covering algorithm whereby
hypotheses are constructed iteratively clause by clause. Typically the covering
algorithm is greedy in the sense that each iteration adds the best clause
according to some local evaluation criterion. Some typical problems of the
covering algorithm are: unnecessarily long hypotheses, difficulties in handling
recursion, difficulties in learning multiple predicates. This paper investigates a
non-covering approach to ILP, implemented as a Prolog program called
HYPER, whose goals were: use intensional background knowledge, handle
recursion well, and enable multi-predicate learning. Experimental results in this
paper may appear surprising in the view of the very high combinatorial
complexity of the search space associated with the non-covering approach.

Abstract                             
In this paper we presen ta statistical learning algorithm for synthesizing
new random instances of a sound texture given an example of such a texture       
as input. A large class of natural and artificial sounds such as rain, waterfall, 
traffic noises, people babble, machine noises, etc., can be regarded as sound     
texturessound signals that are approximately stationary at some scale. 
Treating the input sound texture as a sample of a stochastic process, we  
construct a tree representing a hierarchical wavelet transform of the signal. 
From this tree, new randomtrees are generatedby learningand sampling      
the conditional probabilities of the paths in the original tree. Transformation 
of these random trees back into signals results in new sound textures  
that closely resemble the sonic impression of the original sound source but   
without exactly repeating it. Applications of this method are abundant and     
include, for example, automatic generation of sound effects, creative musical 
and sonic manipulations, and virtual reality sonification. Examples are  
visually demonstrated in the paper and acoustically demonstrated in an accompanying 
website.

"Handling Quantifiers in ILP

Abstract. An important research area in the field of Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) is concerned with predicate learning. Recently, many
predicate learners have been developed whose task consists in learning a
definition of a concept from positive and negative examples. In most of
them, the definition of the concept is represented by a set of definite (or
normal) clauses. The variables that appear in the head of a clause (the
head-variables) are universally quantified, and the variables that appear
only in the body of the clause (the body-variables) are existentially quantified. 
Some predicate learners described in the ILP literature are able to
deal with such existential (body-)variables, using some language bias like
ij-determinacy (see [11]). However, as far as the authors know, no ILP
system is able to deal with clauses in whose body both existential and
universal body-variables appear. Moreover, there exists no generalisation
and no specialisation operator that handle such body-variables.
In this paper, we first present a set of generalisation/specialisation rules
devoted to deal with existential and universal variables that appear only
in the body of the clauses. We then highlight some properties of these
rules, essentially correctness and completeness theorems. We do not explicit 
any type of control that could permit to exploit practically these
rules in an ILP system, however we give some ideas of how to integrate
them in different sorts of systems with minor modifications and without
increasing the search space too greatly.
Following the motivation of ILP systems with respect to more classical 
machine learning ones, an important motivation of these rules is to
extend the expressiveness of the ILP representation formalism (clauses
without any Skolem functions, i.e. with only existential body-variables).
Moreover, a significant interest of the q-operators presented in this paper
is that several existing ILP systems can be adapted (with some modifications) 
to process quantifiers in the body of clauses and thus increase
their expressiveness.

Abstract
Many applications need a lexicon that represents semantic information but acquiring lexical 
information is time consuming. We present a corpus-based bootstrapping algorithm
that assists users in creating domain-specific semantic lexicons quickly. Our algorithm
uses a representative text corpus for the domain and a small set of \seed words"" that
belong to a semantic class of interest. The algorithm hypothesizes new words that are
also likely to belong to the semantic class because they occur in the same contexts as
the seed words. The best hypotheses are added to the seed word list dynamically, and
the process iterates in a bootstrapping fashion. When the bootstrapping process halts, a
ranked list of hypothesized category words is presented to a user for review. We used this
algorithm to generate a semantic lexicon for eleven semantic classes associated with the
MUC-4 terrorism domain.

Abstract. Case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used as a form of caching
solved problems to speedup later problem solving. Using cached cases
brings additional costs with it due to retrieval time, case adaptation time
and also storage space. Simply storing all cases will result in a situation
in which retrieving and trying to adapt old cases will take more time
(on average) than not caching at all. This means that caching must be
applied selectively to build a case memory that is actually useful. This is
a form of the utility problem [4, 2]. The approach taken here is to construct 
a cost model of a system that can be used to predict the effect
of changes to the system. In this paper we describe the utility problem
associated with caching cases and the construction of a cost model.
We present experimental results that demonstrate that the model can
be used to predict the effect of certain changes to the case memory.

ABSTRACT                                        
This paper describes the application of a structured method for integrating non-speech
sound into graphical interfaces. The method analyses interactions in terms of event,  
status and mode information. It then categorises this information in terms of the feedback
needed to present it. This is then combined with guidelines for creating sounds to    
generate the auditory feedback required. As an example, the method is applied to a    
scrollbar. This sonically-enhanced scrollbar is then experimentally evaluated to see if the
auditory enhancements are effective. The results show that the new scrollbar reduced the
time taken to perform certain tasks, it reduced the time taken to recover from errors, it
reduced mental workload and participants preferred it to the standard graphical scrollbar.

Abstract. This paper presents empirical studies, mainly from psychology, on reuse of
knowledge, especially in design. The results are considered relevant to research and development 
in the domain of CBR because of the support function generally attributed to CBR
systems. The data exposed concern both representational and processing aspects of reuse.
The topics discussed are: reuse vs. design ""from scratch""; different stages in reuse, especially 
retrieval; types of entity reused (with respect to their abstraction level, origin, and
product-solution vs. procedure-solution character) and types of their exploitation;
strategies of reuse; frequency of effective reuse; effects of reuse on designers productivity;
difficulties and risks of reuse. The paper closes with possible repercussions for CBR systems 
based on the results presented, and research topics in the domain of reuse of knowledge 
(conditions of reuse, retrieval from memory, and reuse and analogical reasoning).

Abstract
Information perceptualization has been defined to           
include the three domains of Information Visualization,     
Information Sonification and Information Tactilisation      
[1]. While Information Visualization is a developing field  
and Sonification is an emerging field of study, very little 
work has been done to experiment with haptics for the       
display of abstract information. This paper describes       
some pilot studies designed to test the feasibility of using
three different attributes of touch to display nominal or   
ordinal data. These attributes are surface hardness,        
surface roughness and object inertia. The results are       
applied to the display of stock market data on the Haptic   
Workbench.

Abstract                                    
This paper describes ""From Dots to Shapes"" (FDTS), an auditory platform composed by three
classic games (Simon, Point Connecting and concentration game) for blind and visually
impaired pupils. Each game was adapted to work on a concept of the Euclidean geometry (e.g. )
The tool, , is based on sonic and haptic interaction, and therefore could be used by special
educators as a help for teaching basic planar geometry.

layer, domain concepts are organized in hierarchies; different aspects of the system to be
diagnosed are presented in a technical model; the Model-Based inference engine consists
of basic principles operating on the technical model. Within the Case-Based layer,
Model-Based or instructor processed resolutions are stored in a memory of past incident
cases; indexes of various influences and more or less constraining viewpoints are invoked
by the Case-Based inference engine in order to retrieve relevant cases quickly;
explanations and adaptation mles are then used to make case description match and adapt
case resolution. Within the Rule-Based layer, situation rules synthesizing incident
description and validation rules supporting diagnosis assessment are triggered by the
Rule-Based inference engine to solve well-tried, frequent or trivial problems. Integrating
these knowledge layers into a unified model enhances the scope of the resultant
knowledge base. Combining these reasoning modes into a coherent control strategy
improves the efficiency of the target Knowledge-Based System.

Abstract
Nowadays the automotive industry has to face two major challenges. First products must meet
continually increasing government requirements on fuel economy and low exhaust emission.
Second the market demands product variety and short production cycles. The automobiles
combustion system determines the exhaust emission rate, combustion system engineering is
one of the crucial steps in the development process. Cylinder head design is a good example of
showing how enhanced AI technologies like CBR and Machine Learning support high-level
eingineering design tasks.

The work described was coordinated in a joint project between the Daimler-Benz research
group on Thermo and Fluid Dynamics and our reasearch group on Machine Learning with the
aim of improving of cylinder head engineering. This paper proposes how Machine Learning
and specifically Case-based Reasoning (CBR) transform a traditional database containing both
geometry and air-motion data into a so called experience memory for cylinder head design. We
will present the initial steps of our database analysis in terms of different learning algorithms,
then use the extracted knowledge to develop case-based design retrieval and quality prediction
modules.

"Supporting Combined Human and Machine Planning: An Interface for Planning by Analogical Reasoning

Michael T. Cox and Manuela M. Veloso

{mcox;mmv}@cs.cmu.edu


Abstract. Realistic and complex planning situations require a mixed-initiative planning
framework in which human and automated planners interact to mutually construct a
desired plan. Ideally, this joint cooperation has the potential of achieving better plans than
either the human or the machine can create alone. Human planners often take a case-based
approach to planning, relying on their past experience and planning by retrieving and
adapting past planning cases. Planning by analogical reasoning in which generative and
case-based planning are combined, as in Prodigy/Analogy, provides a suitable framework
to study this mixed-initiative integration. However, having a human user engaged in this
planning loop creates a variety of new research questions. The challenges we found creating 
a mixed-initiative planning system fall into three categories: planning paradigms differ
in human and machine planning; visualization of the plan and planning process is a complex, 
but necessary task; and human users range across a spectrum of experience, both
with respect to the planning domaln and the underlying planning technology. This paper
presents our approach to these three problems when designing an interface to incorporate
a human into the process of planning by analogical reasoning with Prodigy/Analogy. The
interface allows the user to follow both generative and case-based planning, it supports
visualization of both plan and the planning rationale, and it addresses the variance in the
experience of the user by allowing the user to control the presentation of information.

ABSTRACT
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large
wireless ad­hoc networks for applications where the message
sequence is not known. We seek to optimize the lifetime of
the network. We show that online power­aware routing does
not have a constant competitive ratio to the offline optimal
algorithm. We develop an approximation algorithm called
max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive ra­tio. 
To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algo­
rithm for power­aware routing. This hierarchical algorithm
is called zone­based routing. Our experiments show that its
performance is quite good.

Abstract. Defining similarity measures is a crucial task when developing 
CBR applications. Particularly, when employing utility-based similarity 
measures rather than pure distance-based measures one is confronted 
with a difficult knowledge engineering task. In this paper we
point out some problems of the state-of-the-art procedure to defining
similarity measures. To overcome these problems we propose an alternative 
strategy to acquire the necessary domain knowledge based on a Machine 
Learning approach. To show the feasibility of this strategy several
application scenarios are discussed and some results of an experimental
evaluation for one of these scenarios are presented.

Abstract
Software project effort estimation is a difficult problem complicated by a variety of
interrelated factors. Current regression-based models have not had much success in
accurately estimating system size. This paper describes a case based reasoning approach to
software estimation which performs somewhat better than regression models based on the
same data and which has some similarity to human expert judgement approaches. An
analysis is performed to determine whether different forms of averaging and adaptation
improve the overall quality of the estimate.

Abstract. Software documentation represents a critical resource to the successful functioning of
many enterprises. However, because it is static, documentation often fails to meet the needs of the
many diverse users who are required to consult it on a regular basis in the course of their daily
work. Software documentation is a rich resource that has not been fully exploited.
Treatment of software documentation presents a number of interesting problems that require
a blend of information retrieval and hypertext techniques for their successful solution. The evolv­ing 
nature of a software project and the diverse demands on its documentation present an espe­cially 
challenging environment. This is made even more challenging by the variety of information
resources, ranging from formal specification languages to source code, that must be integrated
into a coherent whole for the purpose of querying.
In this paper we discuss work in progress at the University of Virginia. We discuss the issues
involved with automating the management of software documentation to better increase its utility.
We describe a prototype system, SLEUTH, currently under investigation as a vehicle for software
documentation management. The prototype maintains software documentation as a hypertext
with typed links for the purpose of browsing by users with varying needs. These links are gener­ated 
mechanically by the system and kept accurate under update. Appropriate authoring tools pro­vide 
the system with the information it needs for this maintenance function. Ad hoc querying is
provided over the documentation and hypertext documents are synthesized in response to these
queries.

Abstract
This paper focuses on Hybrid Symbolic Neural Ar­chitectures 
that support the task of classifying tex­tual 
information in learning agents. We give an
outline of these symbolic and neural preference
Moore machines. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how they can be used in the context of information
mining and news classification. Using the Reuters
newswire text data, we demonstrate how hybrid
symbolic and neural machines can provide an ef­fective 
foundation for learning news agents.

Abstract. The Predictive Toxicology Evaluation (or PTE) Challenge
provided Machine Learning techniques with the opportunity to compete
against specialised techniques for toxicology prediction. Toxicity models
that used findings from ILP programs have performed creditably in the
PTE-2 experiment proposed under this challenge. We report here on an
assessment of such models along scales of: (1) quantitative performance,
in comparison to models developed with expert collaboration; and (2)
potential explanatory value for toxicology. Results appear to suggest the
following: (a) across of range of class distributions and error costs, some
explicit models constructed with ILP-assistance appear closer to optimal 
than most expert-assisted ones. Given the paucity of test-data, this
is to be interpreted cautiously; (b) a combined use of propositional and
ILP techniques appears to yield models that contain unusual combinations 
of structural and biological features; and (c) significant effort was
required to interpret the output, strongly indicating the need to invest
greater effort in transforming the output into a toxicologist-friendly
form. Based on the lessons learnt from these results, we propose a new
predictive toxicology evaluation experiment  PTE-3  which will address
some important shortcomings of the previous study.

Abstract. In this paper we present a system which integrates an ECG
waveform classifier (called PECG) with an interactive learner (called
IMPUT). The PECG system is based on an attribute grammar specification 
of ECGs that has been transformed to Prolog. The IMPUT
system combines the interactive debugging technique IDT with the unfolding 
algorithm introduced in SPECTRE. The main result achieved in
the new version of the PECG system is that an ILP method can be used
to improve the effectiveness of a real size Prolog application. Applying
the IMPUT method, the extended PECG system is able to suggest a correct 
solution to the user to replace the buggy clause recognized during
the debugging process.

Abstract. This article presents a combination of unsupervised and supervised 
learning techniques for generation of word segmentation rules
from a list of words. First, a bias for word segmentation is introduced
and a simple genetic algorithm is used for the search of segmentation
that corresponds to the best bias value, In the second phase, the segmentation 
obtained from the genetic algorithm is used as an input for
two inductive logic programming algorithms, namely FOIDL and CLOG.
The result is a logic program that can be used for segmentation of unseen
words. The learnt program contains affixes which are characteristic for
the given language and can be used in other morphology tasks.

Abstract
One of the approaches to cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is based on the use of parallel 
texts. In this paper, we will describe a parallel text mining system called PTMiner (Parallel
Text Miner) for the Web environment. We will explain the underlying mining algorithm of this
system as well as its implementation using a distributed model and database technology. The
resulted corpora are used as the training material for statistical translation models. Preliminary
experimental results using the models for CLIR are reported.

"Lexical Semantics in the Age of the Semantic Web

1. Introduction
Lexical semantics is the study of word meaning. The semantic web is a vision of what the web
could be if it would foremost consist of knowledge (structured data) rather than text or other
unstructured data as it is today. This talk is about the future of word meaning if the semantic
web becomes a reality. First, I will therefore briefly clarify what the semantic web vision
consists of, followed by a sketch of lexical semantics. Finally, I will speculate on how the
inherent semantic standardization process of the semantic web could have a dramatic
influence on the study and use of word meaning.

"MANIPULATION, ANALYSIS AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS FOR AUDIO SIGNALS

GEORGE TZANETAKIS
FACULTY OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

Abstract
Digital audio and especially music collections are becoming a major part of the average
computer user experience. Large digital audio collections of sound effects are also used by
the movie and animation industry. Research areas that utilize large audio collections in­
clude: Auditory Display, Bioacoustics, Computer Music, Forensics, and Music Cognition.
In order to develop more sophisticated tools for interacting with large digital audio
collections, research in Computer Audition algorithms and user interfaces is required.
In this work a series of systems for manipulating, retrieving from, and analysing large
collections of audio signals will be described. The foundation of these systems is the design
of new and the application of existing algorithms for automatic audio content analysis. The
results of the analysis are used to build novel 2D and 3D graphical user interfaces for
browsing and interacting with audio signals and collections. The proposed systems are
based on techniques from the fields of Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition, Information
Retrieval, Visualization and Human Computer Interaction. All the proposed algorithms and
interfaces are integrated under MARSYAS, a free software framework designed for rapid
prototyping of computer audition research. In most cases the proposed algorithms have
been evaluated and informed by conducting user studies.
New contributions of this work to the area of Computer Audition include: a gen­eral 
multifeature audio texture segmentation methodology, feature extraction from mp3
compressed data, automatic beat detection and analysis based on the Discrete Wavelet
Transform and musical genre classification combining timbral, rhythmic and harmonic
features. Novel graphical user interfaces developed in this work are various tools for
browsing and visualizing large audio collections such as the Timbregram, TimbreSpace,
GenreGram, and Enhanced Sound Editor.

Abstract. This paper describes a bottom-up ILP algorithm called MRI,
which induces recursive programs with one or more recursive clauses from
a few of examples. It analyzes saturations using path structures, which
express streams of terms processed by predicates and was originally introduced 
by Identam-Almquist. We introduce extension and difference
of path structures. Recursive clauses can be expressed as a difference
among path structures. The paper also shows experimental results.

Abstract:
This article deals with the prediction of processes. Research work on this
topic considers some well known processes. Their prediction is based on a
model which takes precisely into account the influence of the parameters
involved in the modification of their state. Such models are not conceivable
here : the point is indeed of some processes that human beings control little,
like forest fires, which is the subject of the system presented here. The
reasoning that it uses relies on cases. We consider indeed that if two processes
behaved the same way during a certain interval then their behaviours are very
likely to be similar afterwards. The matching is based on an approximate
string matching. Because of the complexity of the handled processes, points
of view have been introduced. Their consideration requires a matching
adapted to each one. They are presented here.

Abstract. There is a general acceptance that a case-based assistance
system that can meet the requirements of real-world complex applications 
should maintain a core of domain specific knowledge in combination
with its case store. The presented DOM-ArC incorporates a domain ontology 
and is situated within a case-based design support system. The
domain ontology incorporates not only deep domain knowledge, but also
the decision making knowledge that ensures the quality and reliability of
the domain cases. The DOM-ArC undertakes the role of an active assistant 
that supports the case-based reasoner with the following services.
It reviews and analyses a case and makes suggestions about which case
to retain, how to overcome deficiencies in a proposed solution, which
solution to reject, and how to construct a case from scratch.

Abstract. Expert systems for decision support have recently been successfully 
introduced in road transport management. These systems include knowledge
 on traffic problem detection and alleviation. The paper
describes experiments in automated acquisition of knowledge on traffic
problem detection. The task is to detect road sections where a problem
has occured (critical sections) from sensor data. It is necessary to use
inductive logic programming (ILP) for this purpose as relational background 
knowledge on the road network is essential. In this paper, we
apply three state-of-the art ILP systems to learn how to detect traffic
problems and compare their performance to the performance of a propositional 
learning system on the same problem.

"Combining LAPIS and WordNet for the Learning of LR Parsers with Optimal Semantic Constraints

Dimitar Kazakov

University of York, Heslington, York YO1O 5DD, UK

WWW home page: http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~kazakov/



Abstract. There is a history of research focussed on learning of shift-reduce 
parsers from syntactically annotated corpora by the means of
machine learning techniques based on logic. The presence of lexical semantic 
tags in the treebank has proved useful for learning semantic constraints 
which limit the amount of nondeterminism in the parsers. The
level of generality of the semantic tags used is of direct importance to
that task. We combine the ILP system LAPIS with the lexical resource
WordNet to learn parsers with semantic constraints. The generality of
these constraints is automatically selected by LAPIS from a number of options 
provided by the corpus annotator. The performance of the parsers
learned is evaluated on an original corpus also described in the article.

Abstract. This paper describes a technique for integrating case-based
reasoning with model-based reasoning to predict the behavior of biological 
systems characterized both by incomplete models and insufficient
empirical data for accurate induction. This technique is implemented in
GARMA, a system for rangeland pest management advising. CARMAs
ability to predict the forage consumption judgments of 15 expert entomologists 
was empirically compared to that of CARMAs case-based and
model-based components in isolation. This evaluation confirmed the hypothesis 
that integrating model-based and case-based reasoning through
model-based adaptation can lead to more accurate predictions than the
use of either technique individually.

"Learning to Improve Case Adaptation by Introspective Reasoning and CBR*

David B. Leake, Andrew Kinley, and David Wilson

Computer Science Department
Lindley Hall 215, Indiana University
Bloomington, IN 47405, U.S.A.



Abstract. In current CBR systems, case adaptation is usually performed 
by rule-based methods that use task-specific rules hand-coded
by the system developer. The ability to define those rules depends on
knowledge of the task and domain that may not be available a priori,
presenting a serious impediment to endowing CBR systems with the
needed adaptation knowledge. This paper describes ongoing research on
a method to address this problem by acquiring adaptation knowledge
from experience. The method uses reasoning from scratch, based on introspective 
reasoning about the requirements for successful adaptation,
to build up a library of adaptation cases that are stored for future reuse. 
We describe the tenets of the approach and the types of knowledge
it requires. We sketch initial computer implementation, lessons learned,
and open questions for further study.

A Series of Three Mixed Reality Workshops: Sounding Out  Sound in Mixed Reality Environment

ABSTRACT                      
The second workshop in the series of practical mixed reality workshops, defined in
Workpackage 7b.1, focusses on sound. This is the topic with which most of the eRENA
partners have to deal: finding technical and aesthetic solutions for sound, within an image
oriented mixed environment. Virtual (and mixed) reality environments often lack a
convincing solution for all aspects of sound.
The  workshop took place at the ZKM, on December, 2nd and 3rd 1999. Five lectures
and demonstrations, presented by eRENA partners collaborators, alternated with
discussions among the participants.
The deliverable documents the content of the workshop structured in four parts: sound
in relation to its form of data, in relation to space, to image, and to interaction. One of the
achievements of the workshop was in showing how many different relationships are
existing around these four aspects. Artistic and pragmatic use of sound in mixed reality
environments were regarded as well as the different accesses to visual and audio matters.

Nov 1st - Dec 6th 1998 at the ZKM Institute for Visual Media. The image was projected                   
onto the front wall of a room of 6m width and 7m depth. The projection size was 5 x 3m.                 
The interface consists out of a mixing board plus chair which were installed 4,50m in                   
front of the screen. The image was projected in stereo using Chrystal Eyes Shutter                      
Glasses. The moving sound sources were projected quadrophonically with two speakers                     
in front and two in the rear. SonoMorphis has also been shown during the 11th Stuttgarter               
Filmwinter, Jan 14th - 17th 1999, in the CAVE of the IAO, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in

"Route Planning by Analogy

Abstract. There have been several efforts to create and use real maps in
computer applications that automatically find good map routes. In general, 
online map representations do not include information that may be
relevant for the purpose of generating good realistic routes, including for
example traffic patterns, construction, or number of lanes. Furthermore,
the notion of a good route is dependent on a variety of factors, such as the
time of the day, and may also be user dependent. This motivation leads
to our work on the accumulation and reuse of previously traversed routes
as cases. In this paper, we demonstrate our route planning method which
retrieves and reuses multiple past routing cases that collectively form a
good basis for generating a new routing plan. We briefly present our similarity 
metric for retrieving a set of similar routes. The metric effectively
takes into account the geometric and continuous-valued characteristics of
a city map. We then present the replay mechanism and how the planner
produces the route plan by analogizing from the retrieved similar past
routes. We discuss in particular the strategy used to merge a set of cases
and generate the new route. We use illustrative examples and show some
empirical results from a detailed online map of the city of Pittsburgh
containing over 18,000 intersections and 25,000 street segments.

Abstract. In response to the occurrence of an air incident, controllers at one of
the three Canadian Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC) must make a series of
critical decisions on the appropriate procedures to follow. These procedures
(called incident prosecution) include hypotheses formulation and information
gathering, development of a plan for the search and rescue (SAR) missions and
in the end, the generation of reports. We present in this paper the results of a
project aimed at evaluating the applicability of CBR to help support incident
prosecution in the RCC. We have identified three possible applications of CBR:
Online help, real time support for situation assessment, and report generation.
We present a brief description of the situation assessment agent system that we
are implementing as a result of this study.

"Surviving the Information Explosion: How People Find Their Electronic Information

Christine Alvarado, Jaime Teevan,

AI Memo 2003­006 April 2003

Abstract: We report on a study of how people look for information within email, files,
and the Web. When locating a document or searching for a specific answer, people relied
on their contextual knowledge of their information target to help them find it, often
associating the target with a specific document. They appeared to prefer to use this
contextual information as a guide in navigating locally in small steps to the desired
document rather than directly jumping to their target. We found this behavior was
especially true for people with unstructured information organization. We discuss the
implications of our findings for the design of personal information management tools.

Abstract
An understanding of language processing in humans is
critical if realistic computerised systems are to be pro­duced 
to perform various language operations. The ex­amination 
of aphasia in individuals has provided a large
amount of information on the organisation of language
processing, with particular reference to the regions in the
brain where processing occurs and the ability to regain
language functionality despite damage to the brain. Given
the importance played by aphasic studies an approach that
can distinguish between aphasic forms was devised by
using a Kohonen self­organising network to classify sen­tences 
from the CAP (Comparative Aphasia Project) Cor­pus. 
We demonstrate that the different distributions of
words in aphasics types may lead to grammatical systems
which inhabit different areas in self­organising maps.

Abstract. Shinohara, Arimura, and Krishna Rao have shown learnability 
in the limit of minimal models of classes of logic programs from positive 
only data. In most cases, these results involve logic programs in
which the size of the head yields a bound on the size of the body literals. 
However, when local variables are present, such a bound on body
literal size cannot directly be ensured. The above authors achieve such
a restriction using technical notions like mode and linear inequalities.
The present paper develops a conceptually clean framework where the
behavior of local variables is controlled by nonlocal ones. It is shown that
for certain classes of logic programs, learnablity from positive data is
equivalent to limiting identification of bounds for the number of clauses
and the number of local variables. This reduces the learning problem
finding two integers. This cleaner framework generalizes all the known
results and establishes learnability of new classes.

Abstract - A case-based reasoning system for diagnosing medical equipment, 
called ELSI, has been in use by the GE corporation since 1994. When
a customer or field engineer calls the service center for help with a problem,
the equipments error log is automatically downloaded. In ninety seconds or
less, ELSI displays a sorted list of the best-matching logs in a case base of
previous known problems, shows the fix, service notes, explains which sections 
of the log match, and which fixes each section predicts. This diagnostic
information allows the service center engineer to recommend a temporary
work-around or remote fixes to a customer, or helps a field engineer show
up on site with the right parts the first time.

Abstract. Gold showed in 1967 that not even regular grammars can be
exactly identified from positive examples alone. Since it is known that
children learn natural grammars almost exclusively from positives 
examples, Golds result has been used as a theoretical support for Chomskys
theory of innate human linguistic abilities. In this paper new results are
presented which show that within a Bayesian framework not only 
grammars, but also logic programs are learnable with arbitrarily low expected
error from positive examples only. In addition, we show that the upper
bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes 
posterior probability when learning from positive examples is within a small
additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and
negative examples. An Inductive Logic Programming implementation is
described which avoids the pitfalls of greedy search by global 
optimisation of this function during the local construction of individual clauses
of the hypothesis. Results of testing this implementation on 
artificially-generated data-sets are reported. These results are in agreement with
the theoretical predictions.

Abstract

The design architecture, case representation of actual medical cases, and the implementation of
TROPIX, a tropical disease diagnosis and therapy tool are presented. TROPIX is intended to be
bundled with laptop computers for rural health centers and semi-urban hospitals in developing
countries. Our model uses the ideal domain knowledge to build a decision matrix, DM from
disease features against which new cases are measured using the MVF (Matched Vector
Functions) algorithms. The result of the diagnosis stage provided by the MVF procedure and
other parameters of the features are then used for CBR case retrievals, verification, and case
validation. The final stage in the design yields the selection of 1 or 2 competing cases presented
for reuse and perhaps for subsequent repair and adaptation.
The solution for the new case solved is either one or more actions, a therapy plan or
recommendations. The design demonstrates how we can integrate domain knowledge and
(medical) records with CBR, statistical pattern recognition, and abductive reasoning to build a
knowledge based system.

Abstract                                                     
Sounds are often the result of motions of virtual objects in a virtual environment.
Therefore, sounds and the motions that caused them should be treated in an integrated way.
When sounds and motions do not have the proper correspondence, the resultant confusion
can lessen the effects of each. In this paper, we present an integrated system for modeling,
synchronizing, and rendering sounds for virtual environments. The key idea of the system is
the use of a functional representation of sounds, called timbre trees. This representation is
used to model sounds that are parameterizable. These parameters can then be mapped to the
parameters associated with the motions of objects in the environment. This mapping allows
the correspondence of motions and sounds in the environment. Representing arbitrary sounds
using timbre trees is a difficult process that we do not address in this paper. We describe
approaches for creating some timbre trees including the use of genetic algorithms. Rendering
the sounds in an aural environment is achieved by attaching special environmental nodes that
represent the attenuation and delay as well as the listener effects to the timbre trees. These
trees are then evaluated to generate the sounds. The system that we describe runs parallel in
real-time on an eight processor SGI Onyx. We see the main contribution of the present
system as a conceptual framework on which to consider the sound and motion in an
integrated virtual environment.

Abstract. CaseMaker is an interactive environment for intelligent case-authoring 
support in CREST, a ease-based reasoner for estimation tasks, in
which the selection of cases for addition to a case library is guided by
empirical evaluation of the coverage contributions of candidate eases. We
present a new version of the environment called CaseMaker-2 which is
designed to support ease authoring more effectively by eliminating a
previous requirement for the evaluation of candidate eases to be repeated
following the addition of a new ease to the library. A key role in the
approach is played by eValuate, an algorithm for dynamic partitioning of
the space of uncovered eases in such a way that the partition containing a
given ease represents the minimum additional coverage provided by its
addition to the ease library.

Abstract
This study examines the hypothesis that the ability of a reader to learn
from text depends on the match between the background knowledge of
the reader and the difficulty of the text information. Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA), a statistical technique that represents the content of a
document as a vector in high dimensional semantic space based on a
large text corpus, is used to predict how much readers will learn from
texts based on the estimated conceptual match between their topic
knowledge and the text information. Participants completed tests to
assess their knowledge of the human heart and circulatory system,
then read one of four texts that ranged in difficulty from elementary to
medical school level, then completed the tests again. Results show a
non­monotonic relationship in which learning was greatest for texts
that were neither too easy nor too difficult. LSA proved as effective at
predicting learning from these texts as traditional knowledge
assessment measures. For these texts, optimal assignment of text on the
basis of either pre­reading measure would have increased the amount
learned significantly.

Abstract. This paper describes HICAP, a general-purpose, interactive
case-based plan authoring architecture that can be applied to decision
support tasks to yield a hierarchical course of action. It integrates a hierarchical 
task editor with a conversational case-based planner. HICAP
maintains both a task hierarchy representing guidelines that constrain
the final plan and the hierarchical social organization responsible for
these tasks. It also supports bookkeeping, which is crucial for real-world
large-scale planning tasks. By selecting tasks corresponding to the hierarchys 
leaf nodes, users can activate the conversational case-based planner
to interactively refine guideline tasks into a concrete plan. Thus, HICAP
can be used to generate context sensitive plans and should be useful for
assisting with planning complex tasks such as noncombatant evacuation
operations. We describe an experiment with a highly detailed military
simulator to investigate this claim. The results show that plans generated
by HICAP were superior to those generated by alternative approaches.

Abstract. Because of the complexity of aerospace design, intelligent
systems to support and amplify the abilities of aerospace designers have
the potential for profound impact on the speed and reliability of design 
generation. This article describes a framework for supporting the
interactive capture of design cases and their application to new problems, 
illustrating the approach with a discussion of its use in a support
system for aircraft design. The project integrates case-based reasoning
with interactive tools for capturing expert design knowledge through
concept mapping. Concept mapping tools provide crucial functions
for interactively generating and examining design cases and navigating
their hierarchical structure, while CBR techniques provide capabilities
to facilitate retrieval and to aid interactive adaptation of designs. The
project aims simultaneously to develop a useful design aid and more generally 
to develop practical interactive approaches to fundamental issues
of case acquisition and representation, context-sensitive retrieval, and
case adaptation.

Abstract. CBROnto is an ontology that incorporates common Case-Based 
Reasoning (CBR) terminology and serves as a domain-independ-
ent framework to design CBR applications. It is the core of COLIBRI,
an environment to assist during the design of knowledge intensive CBR
systems that combine cases with various knowledge types and reasoning
methods. CBROnto captures knowledge about CBR tasks and methods,
and aims to unify case specific and general domain knowledge representational 
needs. CBROnto specifies a modelling framework to describe
reusable CBR Problem Solving Methods based on the CBR tasks they
solve. This paper describes CBROntos main ideas and exemplifies them
with an application to generate Spanish poetry versions of texts provided
by the user.

Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (JLP) systems have had noteworthy 
successes in extracting comprehensible and accurate models for
data drawn from a number of scientific and engineering domains. These
results suggest that ILP methods could enhance the model-construction
capabilities of software tools being developed for the emerging discipline
of knowledge discovery from databases. One significant concern in the
use of JLP for this purpose is that of efficiency. The performance of modern 
ILP systems is principally affected by two issues: (1) they often have
to search through very large numbers of possible rules (usually in the
form of definite clauses); (2) they have to score each rule on the data
(usually in the form of ground facts) to estimate goodness . Stochastic
and greedy approaches have been proposed to alleviate the complexity
arising from each of these issues. While these techniques can result in
order-of-magnitude improvements in the worst-case search complexity of
an ILP system, they do so at the expense of exactness. As this may be
unacceptable in some situations, we examine two methods that result in
admissible transformations of clauses examined in a search. While the
methods do not alter the size of the search space (that is, the number 
of clauses examined), they can alleviate the theorem-proving effort
required to estimate goodness. The first transformation simply involves
eliminating literals using a weak test for redundancy. The second involves
partitioning the set of literals within a clause into groups that can be
executed independently of each other. The efficacy of these transformations 
are evaluated empirically on a number of well-known LLP datasets.
The results suggest that for problems that require the use of highly 
non-determinate predicates, the transformations can provide significant gains
as the complexity of clauses sought increases.

Abstract: This report describes our tests on applying statistical translation models for bilingual IR
tasks in CLEF­2001. These translation models have been trained on a set of parallel web pages
automatically mined from the Web. Our previous studies have shown the utility of such corpora for
cross­language information retrieval. The goal of the current tests is to see how we can improve the
quality of the translation models and make best uses of them. Several questions are considered: Is
it useful to consider the IDF factor in addition to the translation probabilities? Is it useful to further
clean the training corpora before model training or the translation models themselves? How could
we combine the translation models with bilingual dictionaries? Although our test do not allow us to
answer all these questions, they provide useful indication to several further research directions.

Abstract. In this paper we argue that the use of a language with a type system,
together with higher-order facilities and functions, provides a suitable basis for
knowledge representation in inductive concept learning and, in particular, illuminates 
the relationship between attribute-value learning and inductive logic
programming (ILP). Individuals are represented by closed terms: tuples of constants 
in the case of attribute-value learning; arbitrarily complex terms in the
case of ILP. To illustrate the point, we take some learning tasks from the
machine learning and ILP literature and represent them in Escher, a typed,
higher-order, functional logic programming language being developed at the
University of Bristol. We argue that the use of a type system provides better
ways to discard meaningless hypotheses on syntactic grounds and encompasses
many ad hoc approaches to declarative bias.

ABSTRACT                                 
This paper proposes the sonification of the activity of a computer 
system that allows the user to monitor the basic performance     
parameters of the system, like CPU load, read and write activity                                            
of the hard disk or network traffic. Although, current computer  
systems still produce acoustic background noise, future and                                                 
emerging computer systems will be more and more optimized                                                   
with respect to their noise emission. In contrast to most of the                                            
concepts of auditory feedback, which present a particular sound                                             
as a feedback to a users command, the proposed feedback is                                                 
mediated by the running computer system. The users interaction                                             
stimulates the system and hence the resulting feedback offers                                               
more realistic information about the current states of                                                      
performance of the system. On the one hand the proposed                                                     
sonification can mimic the acoustical behavior of operating                                                 
components inside a computer system, while on the other hand,                                               
new qualities can be synthesized that enrich interaction with the                                           
device. Different forms of sound effects and generation for the                                             
proposed auditory feedback are realized to experiment with the                                              
usage in an environment of silent computer systems.

"Towards the Integration of Case-Based, Schema-Based and Model-Based Reasoning for Supporting Complex Design Tasks*

Abstract. This paper presents an approach of how to build bridges between 
case-based and model-based reasoning. Unlike other approaches,
these bridges do not intend to surmount the whole abstraction distance 
between concrete cases and generic models in one step. Instead
they introduce and use a web of supporting columns which consist of useful 
intermediate representations called schemata, prototypes, patterns,
templates or whatever is a suitable characterisation for their functional
role in the design process.
The paper begins with a short summary of our knowledge acquisition
experiences in a building design domain which led to the introduction of
topological schemata. It continues with some concrete examples for the
representation and integrated use of these different kinds of knowledge
chunks introduced and gives a short overview of the state of our current
implementation. In the end the paper summarises the main benefits of
integrated case-/schema-/model-based approaches.

Abstract. Memory-based reasoning systems are a class of reasoners that derive
solutions to new problems based on past experiences. Such reasoners use a
long-term memory (LTM) to act as a knowledge base of these past experiences,
which may be represented by such things as specific events (i.e. cases), plans,
scripts, etc. This paper describes a Unified Long-Term Memory (ULTM)
system, which is a dynamic, conceptual memory that was designed to be a
general LTM capable of simultaneously supporting multiple intentional
reasoning systems. Through a unique mixture of content-independent and
domain-specific mechanisms, the ULTM is able to flexibly provide reasoners
accurate and timely storage and recall of episodic memory structures. In
addition, the ULTM provides support for recognizing opportunities to satisfy
suspended goals, allowing reasoning systems to better cope with the
unpredictability of dynamic real-world domains by helping them take advantage
of unexpected events.

Abstract
Often, information retrieval from various other
media is analogous to text­based retrieval; how­
ever, accessing documents in e.g. audio or video
formats causes some extra problems, in particular
with respect to document segmentation, choice
of indexing features, and robustness. We review
these diOEculties, together with some previous at­
tempts to overcome them, and then describe a
very AEexible, modular IR system which has been
designed with a speciøc eye towards these issues.

Abstract. Building a methodology for developing and maintaining CBR
applications is an important goal currently addressed by CBR researchers
and practitioners. Since GBR application development is a special kind
of software development, building a CBR methodology can certainly be
viewed as a software engineering research and development activity. This
paper presents a perspective of how software process modeling, which is
a recent approach in software engineering, can be used for building a
case-based reasoning methodology. Further we describe a case study to
show the applicability of the proposed concepts.

ABSTRACT
In Scientific Visualization, distributed architectures and the World-Wide-Web allow remote access to
expensive resources, and the cooperation amongst teams of experts that are located in different places,
empowering its applications. The use of sound as a data display tool (sonification) has been shown to
support information understanding and may help dealing with adding dimensions to a visual display.
Thus far those issues have been treated separately, although sonification may have implications on
how a system is built. This paper presents an architecture and a corresponding prototype
implementation of a distributed system for visualization that incorporates some of these resources and
technologies, such as visualization on the web, distributed visualization, and sonification. The paper
also presents the evolution of the distribution approach, which, in an earlier implementation,
employed CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and in the current implementation
uses the XML-based protocol SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) as a tool for distribution on the
computer network. A discussion on the use of both distribution tools in visualization tasks is given.

ABSTRACT                                      
We present an Auditory Information Seeking Principle (AISP)                             
(gist, navigate, filter, and details-on-demand) modeled after the                       
visual information seeking mantra [1]. We propose that data                             
sonification designs should conform to this principle. We also                          
present some design challenges imposed by human auditory                                
perception characteristics. To improve blind access to geo-referenced 
statistical data, we developed two preliminary        
sonifications adhering to the above AISP, an enhanced table and  
a spatial choropleth map. Our pilot study shows people can                              
recognize geographic data distribution patterns on a real map                           
with 51 geographic regions, in both designs. The study also                             
shows evidence that AISP conforms to peoples information                               
seeking strategies. Future work is discussed, including the                             
improvement of the choropleth map design.

Abstract. This paper investigates memory issues that influence long-term 
creative problem solving and design activity, taking a case-based
reasoning perspective. Our exploration is based on a well-documented
example: the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We
abstract Bells reasoning and understanding mechanisms that appear
time and again in long-term creative design. We identify that the understanding 
mechanism is responsible for analogical anticipation of design
constraints and analogical evaluation, beside case-based design. But an
already understood design can satisfy opportunistically suspended design
problems, still active in background. The new mechanisms are integrated
in a computational model, ALEC1, that accounts for some creative behavior 
in case-based design.

Relevance, one of the fundamental notions in Information Retrieval (IR),
has long been studied from a cognitive point of view. It is known that
relevance depends not only on the topic of the document and the
information need expressed in a query, but also on other ""situational""
factors in the retrieval situation, such as the user's previous knowledge,
background, intentions, and so on. Formal models, on the other hand,
usually consider relevance from a system point of view, i.e. they isolate
relevance in a restricted context in which only the topic matters. One of
the reasons for this very partial modeling is due to the inappropriateness
of standard formal tools for describing relevance in a general context.
This paper is an attempt to identify a more appropriate logical framework
for the modeling. Counterfactual conditional logic is examined with
respect to the IR requirements, indicating the logic's high potential value
for this task. A particular conditional logic is then defined which, in
comparison with previous developments on conditional logic, is better
suited to IR. The new model gives an insight into the phenomena related
to the ""situational"" factors of relevance judgment which, until now, have
not been considered.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is often used for petiodical inspection of infrastructure 
(e.g. railroads, pipelines). The inspection results in huge amounts of data
which usually has to be analysed by an operator (or a team of operators) for occurrence 
of defect indications. This paper presents an example of use of case-based reasoning 
in interpretation of data from non-destructive testing, namely, a prototype for
classification of images from an ultrasonic rail-inspection system. The reasons for the
choice of case-based reasoning instead of statistical classification or a rule-based expert-system 
approach are explained. The overall design of the prototype is described
and observations and conclusions relating to the prototype and generally to the use of
CBR for NDT are presented.

Abstract. In this paper we propose a large case-based reasoner for the legal domain.
Analyzing legal texts for indexing purposes makes the implementation of large case
bases a complex task. We present a methodology to automatically convert legal texts
into legal cases guided by domain expert knowledge in a rule-based system with
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This methodology can be generalized
to be applied in different domains making Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) paradigm a
powerful technology to solve real world problems with large knowledge sources.

Abstract. In this paper, we describe our approach in CLEF Cross­ Language IR
(CLIR) tasks. In our experiments, we used statistical translation models for
query translation. Some of the models are trained on parallel web pages that are
automatically mined from the Web. Others are trained from bilingual
dictionaries and lexical databases. These models are combined in query
translation. Our goal in this series of experiments is to test if the parallel web
pages can be used effectively to translate queries in multilingual IR. In
particular, we compare models trained on Web documents with models that also
combine other resources such as dictionaries. Our results show that the models
trained on the parallel web pages can achieve reasonable CLIR performance.
However, combining models effectively is a difficult task, and single models
still yield better results.

Abstract. An important focus of recent CBR research is on how to
develop strategies for achieving compact, competent case-bases, as a
way to improve the performance of CBR systems. However, compactness 
and competence are not always good predictors of performance,
especially when problem distributions are non-uniform. Consequently,
this paper argues for developing methods that tie case-base maintenance
more directly to performance concerns. The paper begins by examining
the relationship between competence and performance, discussing the
goals and constraints that should guide addition and deletion of cases. It
next illustrates the importance of augmenting competence-hased criteria 
with quantitative performance-hased considerations, and proposes a
strategy for closely reflecting adaptation performance effects when compressing 
a case-base. It then presents empirical studies examining the
performance tradeoffs of current methods and the benefits of applying
fine-grained performance-based criteria to case-base compression, showing 
that performance-based methods may be especially important for
task domains with non-uniform problem distributions.

Abstract. In this paper, we perform an average-case analysis of k-nearest 
neighbor classifier (k-NNC) for a subclass of Boolean threshold
functions. Our average-case analysis is based on the formal computation 
for the predictive accuracy of the classifier under the assumption of
noise-free Boolean features and a uniform instance distribution. The predictive 
accuracy is represented as a function of the number of features,
the threshold, the number of training instances, and the number of nearest 
neighbors. We also present the predictive behavior of the classifier
by systematically varying the values of the parameters of the accuracy
function. We plot the behavior of the classifier by varying the value of
k, and then we observe that the performance of the classifier improves
as k increases, then reaches a maximum before starting to deteriorate.
We further investigate the relationship between the number of training
instances and the optimal value of k We then observe that optimum k
increases gradually as the number of training instances increases.

Abstract. We present a novel application of ILP to the problem of
diterpene structure elucidation from 13C NMR spectra. Diterpenes are
organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton
of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial
interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new
pharmaceutical effectors. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based
on 13C NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with
specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. 
In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom
number that corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the
diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address 
the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak
patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional
learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra 
with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is
a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification 
process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem
of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.

"Tcl Commands as Media in a Distributed Multimedia Toolkit *

Jonathan L. Herlocker

Department of Computer Science

Minneapolis, MN 55455
{herlocke,konstan}@cs.umn.edu

Introduction
Conventional multimedia applications focus on audio, video, image, and text media. In this paper, we
introduce a more flexible and more powerful medium­­a stream of commands. This stream of commands­
­Tcl[1] commands in particular­can be used to implement animation, device control, user­interfaces, and
many other less­conventional media types.
A command stream is a real­time medium composed of discrete commands. The commands may reside
anywhere on the network, but they are executed locally on the machine where other medias are displayed.
More generally, they may reside and be executed on any network­connected machines. Since a command
stream will be only one media type in an integrated multimedia toolkit, we must be able to operate on it
like any other media stream. Therefore a command stream must support the following operations:
. Playback in reverse.
. Playback at variable speeds (normal, fast­forward, fast­rewind).
. Random access to any point of the stream.
. Synchronization with discrete elements of other media streams, such as video frames and
audio samples.
Tcl commands are particularly useful as the basis for the command stream. They are general, placing few
restrictions on the actions we can perform. Tcl also provides a ready­to­use interpreter and integration
into a networked environment [2]. Tcl commands can be used to access powerful libraries such as Tk[1],
to generate user interfaces, and Expect[3], to operate interactive processes.
We implemented the Tcl command stream as a new medium for the Berkeley Continuous Media Toolkit
(CMT) [4]. CMT provides support for several media types (including audio & video), network transmis­sion 
of media, and a timeline based synchronization mechanism (shared logical clock.) By adding the Tcl
stream to CMT, we are able to integrate Tcl streams with other media in presentations.
This paper presents the Tcl command stream and it's implementation. We begin with a brief introduction
to the Continuous Media Toolkit, followed by a description and discussion of experiences with TclStream
1.0, the initial implementation of the command stream. We follow this with a discussion of one of the
fundamental challenges in command streams ­ developing an authoring interface that allows real people
to create them. We conclude the paper with our plans for TclStream 2.0, some observations about Tcl 
fea­tures we would like to have, and some general conclusions.

Abstract. We can learn a lot about what features are important for
retrieval by comparing similar cases in a case-base. We can determine
which features are important in predicting outcomes and we can assign
weights to features accordingly. In the same manner we can discover
which features are important in specific contexts and determine
localised feature weights that are specific to individual cases. In this
paper we describe a comprehensive set of techniques for learning local
feature weights and we evaluate these techniques on a case-base for
conflict resolution in air traffic control. We show how introspective
learning of feature weights improves retrieval and how it can be used to
determine context sensitive local weights. We also show that
introspective learning does not work well in case-bases containing only
pivotal cases because there is no redundancy to be exploited.

ABSTRACT                                                                                     

We describe, evaluate and analyze an integrated musical visualization system for
assessing protein structural alignments. Super positions of protein structures in
three-dimensiona lspace are visualized using the molecular graphics program Rasmol.
Four environment parameters are examined: secondary structure, polarity, exposure, and
goodness-of- t. It is dif cult to assess these parameters using visualization alone.
Therefore, we employed melodic components with unique characteristics to convey
these four parameters to the user. We used basic music theory (arranging, voiceleading, 
developmentof melodicphrases,etc.) as the basis for soni cation parameters. We attempted to
maximize the individuality of the soni cation elements by employing sound effects such a 
spanning a voice to the left or right speaker and parameter adjustment such as changing its
volume. To validate the utility of our system, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the 
performance of users in estimating the value of these four variables under three distinct
modes: visual, musical, and visual+musical presentation. The preliminary raw results
of our experiments were reported in a near lier work[4]. We also conducted experiments when 
all the four variables were played together in a symphony-like fashi onto assess the impact 
of presenting several variables simultaneously. Raw results seemed to indicate that the 
visual+musical delivery is more effective than the visual delivery alone in most cases.
In this work, we present the results of statistical tests and their implications. We found 
that the accuracy performance was statistically signi cantly better in the Audio Only mode in
comparison to the Visual only mode both in the case of single variable presentation and the 
multiple variable presentation.

Abstract.
An induction-based method for retrieving similar cases and/or easily
adaptable cases is presented in a 3-steps procesa first, a rule set is
learned from a data set ; second, a reformulation of the problem domam
is derived from this ruleset ; third, a surface similarity with respect to the
reformulated problem appears to be a structural similarity with respect
to the initisi representation of the domam. This method achieves some
integration between machine learning and case-based reasoning it uses
both compiled knowledge (through the similarity measure and the ruleset
it is derived from) and instanciated knowledge (through the cases).

Abstract. The case-based reasoning paradigm is applied in support of decision
making processes related to pile foundations. Based on this paradigm, the
system accumulates experience from previously realized pile foundations. This
experience can be drawn when new situations with similar attributes of
geotechnical situation of the site and geometric characteristics of the piles are
encountered. Two case libraries were created based on previously realized sites.
The representativeness of the case libraries and the efficiency of the search
process are facilitated by the use of a genetic algorithm reduction.

"Learning Strategies for Explanation Patterns: Basic Game Patterns with Application to Chess

Yaakov Kemer

kerner@bimacs.cs.biu.ac.il



Abstract. In this paper we describe game-independent strategies, capable of
learning explanation patterns (XPs) for evaluation of any basic game pattern. A
basic game pattern is defined as a minimal configuration of a small number of
pieces and squares which describes only one salient game feature. Each basic
pattern can be evaluated by a suitable XP. We have developed five game-independent 
strategies (replacement, specialization, generalization, deletion,
and insertion) capable of learning XPs or parts of them. Learned XPs can direct
players attention to important analysis that might have been overlooked
otherwise. These XPs can improve their understanding, evaluating and
planning abilities. At present, the application is only in the domain of chess.
The proposed strategies have been further developed into 21 specific chess
strategies, which are incorporated in an intelligent educational chess system
that is under development.

Abstract. In this paper, we will introduce an inductive learning algorithm 
called Prototype-Based Learning (PBL). PBL learns a concept
description, which consists of both prototypical attributes and attribute
importances, by using a distance metric based on prototype-theory and
information-theory. PBL can learn the concept description from even a
small set of training cases and is tolerant of inappropriate cases. Furthermore, 
even the attribute importance differs depending on the combinations of the 
other attribute-value pairs present describing the case,
PBL can learn the concept description and highly utilize it so as to do
the accurate classification. Finally, PBL can learn indexing knowledge
directly from the concept description, which is useful for a human expert 
to understand and verify the concept description generated by the
learning algorithm.

Abstract. Case-Based Reasoning is a good framework for Software Reuse 
because it provides a flexible and powerful searching mechanism
for software components. In a CBR system for software reuse it is important 
to learn the user preferences adapting the system software
choices to the user. In a complex domain as software design, the similarity 
metric will also be complex, thus creating the necessity for a
learning algorithm capable of weight learning. In this paper we present
an evolutionary approach to similarity weight learning in a CBR system
for software reuse. This approach is justified by the similarity metric
complexity and recursive nature, which makes other learning methods to
fail. We present experimental work showing the feasibility of this approach 
and we also present a parametric study, exploring several crossover 
and mutation strategies.

ABSTRACT                                                                                          
Quantum mechanics states a particle can behave as either a particle or a wave. Thus systems of 
particles might be likened to a complex superposition of dynamic waves. Motivated by this, the 
author develops methods for the sonification of particle systems in a logical manner. Many 
systems and physical phenomena have thus far been simulated, producing a wide range of
unique sonic events. The applications that have been explored are for algorithmic sound 
synthesis and music composition. Of critical importance is addressing the issue of latencies,
caused by large complex numerical operations at audio sampling rates.
This becomes painfully clear when particles interact with each other. Further applications of
this system include scientific sonification, with an appropriate integration of psycho 
acoustic principles; creating an application for physics and music students to extend 
and enrich their comprehension of both topics; and inspiring philosophical dialogue regarding
the similarities, intersections, and interdependence of Art and Science. Futurework aims to 
produce a real-time application for simulated and real systems, and a deeper integration
of quantum mechanics into these techniques.

"Completing Inverse Entailment

Stephen Muggleton

Department of Computer Science

Abstract. Yamamoto has shown that the Inverse Entailment(IE) mechanism 
described previously by the author is complete for Plotkins relative 
subsumption but incomplete for entailment. That is to say, an hypothesised 
clause H can be derived from an example E under a background theory B 
using IE if and only if H subsumes E relative to B in
Plotkins sense. Yamamoto gives examples of H for which B U H |= E
but H cannot be constructed using IE from B and E. The main result of
the present paper is a theorem to show that by enlarging the bottom set
used within IE, it is possible to make a revised version of IE complete
with respect to entailment for Horn theories. Furthermore, it is shown
for function-free definite clauses that given a bound k on the arity of
predicates used in B and E, the cardinality of the enlarged bottom set
is bounded above by the polynomial function p(c + 1)k, where p is the
number of predicates in B, E and c is the number of constants in B U E.

Abstract. We introduce a distance measure based on the idea that two
vectors are considered similar if they lead to similar predictive probability 
distributions. The suggested approach avoids the scaling problem
inherent to many alternative techniques as the method automatically
transforms the original attribute space to a probability space where all
the numbers lie between 0 and 1. The method is also flexible in the sense
that it allows different attribute types (discrete or continuous) in the
same consistent framework. To study the validity of the suggested measure, 
we ran a series of experiments with publicly available data sets.
The empirical results demonstrate that the unsupervised distance measure 
is sensible in the sense that it can be used for discovering the hidden
clustering structure of the data.

Abstract. Induction in first-order logic languages suffers from an additional 
factor of complexity compared to induction in attribute-value
languages: the number of possible matchings between a candidate hypothesis 
and a training example.
This paper investigates the use of a stochastic bias to control this factor
of complexity: the exhaustive exploration of the matching space is replaced 
by considering a fixed number of matchings, obtained by random
sampling. One thereby constructs from positive and negative examples
a theory which is only approximately consistent. Both the degree of approximation 
and the computational cost of induction are controlled from
the number of samples allowed.
This approach is illustrated and validated on the mutagenesis problem.
An ad hoc sampling mechanism has been purposely designed, and experimental 
results fully demonstrates the power of stochastic approximate
induction, in terms of both predictive accuracy and computational cost.
Furthermore, this approach applies for learning both logic programs (as it
is usually the case in ILP) and constrained logic programs, i.e. extended
logic programs that can naturally handle numerical information. The
gain of learning constrained logic programs for the mutagenesis problem
is evaluated by comparing the predictive accuracy of the theories induced
in both languages.

"Analogical Asides on Case-Based Reasoning

Mark T. Keane

Department of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, IRELAND



Abstract. This paper explores some of the similarities and differences
between cognitive models of analogy and case-based reasoning systems.
I first point out a paradox in the treatment of adaptation in analogy
and in case-based reasoning; a paradox which can be only resolved by
expanding the role of adaptation in cognitive models of analogy. Some
psychological research on the process of adaptation in human subjects
is reported and then the implications of this research are propagated
into analogy and then on into CBR. The argument is that some of the
existing stages in CBR should be integrated into a more stream-lined
architecture that would be more efficient than current schemes.

Abstract
We explore the idea of creating a subjectiv­ity 
classifier that uses lists of subjective nouns
learned by bootstrapping algorithms. The goal
of our research is to develop a system that
can distinguish subjective sentences from ob­jective 
sentences. First, we use two bootstrap­ping 
algorithms that exploit extraction patterns
to learn sets of subjective nouns. Then we
train a Naive Bayes classifier using the subjec­tive 
nouns, discourse features, and subjectivity
clues identified in prior research. The boot­strapping 
algorithms learned over 1000 subjec­tive 
nouns, and the subjectivity classifier per­formed 
well, achieving 77% recall with 81%
precision.

"Communication in Key Distribution Schemes \Lambda

Abstract
A (g; b) key distribution scheme allows conferences of g users to generate secret keys,
such that disjoint coalitions of b users cannot gain any information on the generated
key (in the information theoretic sense). In this work, we study the relationships
between communication and space efficiency of key distribution schemes. We prove
that communication does not help in the context of unrestricted schemes. On the
other hand, we show that for restricted schemes, which are secure only when used by
a limited number of conferences, communication can substantially improve the space
efficiency. We also present lower bounds on the space efficiency of restricted schemes.
Index Terms -- Key Distribution, communicating protocols, space efficiency, one
time schemes, cryptography.

Abstract
In recent years scientific visualization has been driven by the need                                                          
to visualize high-dimensional data sets within high-dimensional                                                              
spaces. However most visualization methods are designed to show  
nly some statistical features of the data set. This paper deals with                                                        
the visualization of trajectories of high-dimensional dynamical sytems 
which form a L n data set of a smoothn-dimensional ow.     
Three methods that are based on the idea of parallel coordinates 
are presented and discussed. Visualizations done with these new                                                              
methods are shown and an interactive visualization tool for the exploration 
of high-dimensional dynamical systems is proposed.

Abstract. We present the learning system MACCENT which addresses
the novel task of stochastic MAximum ENTropy modeling with Clausal
Constraints. Maximum Entropy method is a Bayesian method based on
the principle that the target stochastic model should be as uniform as
possible, subject to known constraints. MACCENT incorporates clausal
constraints that are based on the evaluation of Prolog clauses in examples 
represented as Prolog programs. We build on an existing maximum-likelihood 
approach to maximum entropy modeling, which we upgrade
along two dimensions: (1) MACCENT can handle larger search spaces,
due to a partial ordering defined on the space of clausal constraints, and
(2) uses a richer first-order logic format. In comparison with other inductive 
logic programming systems, MACCENT seems to be the first that
explicitly constructs a conditional probability distribution p(C|I) based
on an empirical distribution p(C|I) (where p(C|I) (p(C|I)) equals the
induced (observed) probability of an instance I belonging to a class C).
First experiments indicate MACCENT may be useful for prediction, and
for classification in cases where the induced model should be combined
with other stochastic information sources.

Abstract: 
There have been a number of interesting applications of A-Life in
music, ranging from associating musical notes to the cells of cellular automata,
to forging genotypes of musical parameters for generating music using genetic
algorithms. From the three approaches surveyed in this paper, only the cultural
approach allows for the study of the circumstances and mechanisms whereby  
music might originate and evolve in virtual communities of musicians and   
listeners. This approach considers musical systems in the context of the origins
and evolution of cultural conventions that may emerge under a number of    
constraints, such as psychological, physiological and ecological constraints.

Abstract. The general aim of the present paper is to show the advantages 
of the model-theoretic approach to Inductive Logic Programming. 
The paper introduces a new generality ordering between Horn
clauses, called A-subsumption. It is stronger than e-subsumption and
weaker than generalized subsumption. Most importantly A-subsumption
allows to compare clauses in a local sense, i.e. with respect to a partial
interpretation. This allows to define a non-trivial upper bound in the 
Asubsumption lattice without the use of negative examples. An algorithm
for concept learning from positive-only examples, based on these ideas,
is described and its performance is empirically evaluated in the paper.

"EXTRACTION­BASED TEXT CATEGORIZATION: GENERATING DOMAIN­SPECIFIC ROLE RELATIONSHIPS AUTOMATICALLY

Abstract. In previous work, we developed several algorithms that use in­formation 
extraction techniques to achieve high­precision text categoriza­tion. 
The relevancy signatures algorithm classifies texts using extraction
patterns, and the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm classifies texts
using extraction patterns and semantic features associated with role fillers
(Riloff and Lehnert, 1994). These algorithms relied on hand­coded training
data, including annotated texts and a semantic dictionary. In this chapter,
we describe two advances that significantly improve the practicality of our
approach. First, we explain how the extraction patterns can be generated
automatically using only preclassified texts as input. Second, we present
the word­augmented relevancy signatures algorithm that uses lexical items
to represent domain­specific role relationships instead of semantic features.
Using these techniques, we can automatically build text categorization sys­tems 
that benefit from domain­specific natural language processing.
Natural language processing and information retrieval evolved as sepa­rate 
research areas. To a large extent, the difference between them revolves
around the amount of knowledge that is used. Natural language processing
(NLP) techniques rely on syntactic and semantic knowledge that is often
manually encoded for a particular topic. Information retrieval (IR) techniques 
typically use general methods for processing large volumes of text
based on statistical word models. These two paradigms reflect a tug­of­war
between the benefits of domain knowledge and the costs and constraints
associated with it.
Our goal has been to bridge this gap by developing methods to acquire
domain knowledge for NLP automatically. Our work focuses on a natural
language processing task called information extraction (IE), which aims
to extract domain­specific information from text. Recent advances in this
area have made it possible to build IE systems with minimal knowledge
engineering. For the last few years, we have been using information ex­traction 
techniques to build text categorization systems that benefit from
natural language processing while requiring little or no manual knowledge
engineering.
In previous work, we demonstrated that information extraction tech­niques 
could be used to achieve high­precision text categorization in some
domains. We used relevancy signatures to classify texts on the basis of
linguistically­motivated extraction patterns, and augmented relevancy sig­natures 
to classify texts using extraction patterns and semantic features
associated with role fillers (Riloff and Lehnert, 1994). Both of these al­gorithms 
performed better than a comparable word­based algorithm in
terrorism and joint venture domains (Riloff, 1994). Much of the domain
knowledge needed for these algorithms could be acquired automatically,
but there were still significant knowledge­engineering bottlenecks lurking
underneath. A manually annotated training corpus was required to gener­ate 
the extraction patterns, and a dictionary of words tagged with semantic
features was needed for the augmented relevancy signatures.
In this article, we describe two advances that significantly improve the
practicality of our approach. First, we explain how the extraction patterns
can be generated automatically using a system called AutoSlog­TS, without
the need for an annotated training corpus. Second, we present a variation of
the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm that does not rely on seman­tic 
features. The new version uses only lexical items to represent role fillers,
which are extracted automatically from the training corpus. Together with
AutoSlog­TS, the word­augmented relevancy signatures represent domain­
specific role relationships that are generated automatically without any
manual knowledge engineering.
In the first section, we describe the extraction patterns used by our
natural language processing system and describe two previous text rep­resentations 
based on these extraction patterns, relevancy signatures and
augmented relevancy signatures. In the second section, we discuss our dic­tionary 
construction system, AutoSlog­TS, that can generate extraction
patterns automatically. The only input to the system is a set of ``preclassi­fied'' 
texts associated with the domain. In the third section, we present the
new word­augmented relevancy signatures representation and algorithm.
Finally, we present experiments comparing the different text representa­tions 
on four categorization tasks related to terrorism. In all cases, the
signature representations performed better than individual words and the
word­augmented signatures performed comparably to the augmented rele­vancy 
signatures with semantic features.

Abstract. Case combination is a difficult problem in Case Based Reasoning, 
as sub-cases often exhibit conflicts when merged together. In our
previous work we formalized case combination by representing each case
as a constraint satisfaction problem, and used the minimum conflicts
algorithm to systematically synthesize the global solution. However, we
also found instances of the problem in which the minimum conflicts algorithm 
does not perform case combination efficiently. In this paper we
describe those situations in which initially retrieved cases are not easily
adaptable, and propose a method by which, to improve case adaptability
with a genetic algorithm. We introduce a fitness function that maintains
as much retrieved case information as possible, while also perturbing
a sub-solution to allow subsequent case combination to proceed more
efficiently.

Abstract. In the context of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus care,
we developed a decision support system that relies on a tight integration
of Case Based Reasoning and Rule Based Reasoning methodologies. In
this paper, we aim at presenting the evaluation strategy we have defined
to test the system accuracy, safety and reliability, and the first results
obtained both on simulated and on real patients data. Reliability was
positively judged by a group of expert diabetologists; an increase in the
performances of the system is foreseen as new knowledge will be acquired,
through its usage in clinical practice.

ABSTRACT
We present a new algorithm for improving retrieval results
by combining document ranking functions: Condorcet­fuse.
Beginning with one of the two major classes of voting proce­dures 
from Social Choice Theory, the Condorcet procedure,
we apply a graph­theoretic analysis that yields a sorting­
based algorithm that is elegant, efficient, and effective. The
algorithm performs very well on TREC data, often outper­forming 
existing metasearch algorithms whether or not rel­evance 
scores and training data is available. Condorcet­fuse
significantly outperforms Borda­fuse, the analogous repre­sentative 
from the other major class of voting algorithms.

{janr,maurice}@cs.kuleuven.ac.be



Abstract. Several learning systems, such as systems based on clustering
and instance based learning, use a measure of distance between objects.
Good measures of distance exist when objects are described by a fixed set
of attributes as in attribute value learners. More recent learning systems
however, use a first order logic representation. These systems represent
objects as models or clauses. This paper develops a general framework
for distances between such objects and reports a preliminary evaluation.

"Surfing the Digital Wave

Generating Personalised TV Listings
using Collaborative, Case-Based Recommendation


Barry Smyth & Paul Cotter

{Barry.Smyth, Paul.Cotter}@ucd.ie



Abstract. In the future digital TV will offer an unprecedented level of
programme choice. We are told that this will lead to dramatic increases in
viewer satisfaction as all viewing tastes are catered for all of the time. However,
the reality may be somewhat different. We have not yet developed the tools to
deal with this increased level of choice (for example, conventional TV guides
will be virtually useless), and viewers will face a significant and frustrating
information overload problem. This paper describes a solution in the form of
the PTV system. PTV employs user profiling and information filtering
techniques to generate web-based TV viewing guides that are personalised for
the viewing preferences of individual users. The paper explains how PTV
constructs graded user profiles to drive a hybrid recommendation technique,
combining case-based and collaborative information filtering methods. The
results of an extensive empirical study to evaluate the quality of PTVs case-based 
and collaborative filtering strategies are also described.

Email : bici@math-info.univ-paris5.fr


Abstract. Case-based reasoning systems are generally devoted to the
realization of a single cognitive task. The need for such systems to perform 
various cognitive tasks questions how to organize their memory
to permit them to be task-adaptive. The case-based reasoning system
adaptive to cognitive tasks presented here is capable to adapt to analysis
tasks as well as synthesis tasks. Its adaptability comes from its memory
composition, both cases and concepts, and from its hierarchical memory
organization, based on multiple points of view, some of them associated
to the various cognitive tasks it performs. For analytic tasks, the most
specific cases are preferably used for the reasoning process. For synthesis 
tasks, the most specific concepts, learnt by conceptual clustering, are
used. An example of this system abilities, in the domain of eating disorders 
in psychiatry, is briefly presented.

ABSTRACT
Reliable communication between parties in a network is a basic
requirement for executing any protocol. Dolev [4] and Dolev et
al. [5] showed that reliable communication is possible if and only
if the communication network is sufficiently connected. Beimel
and Franklin [1] showed that the connectivity requirement can be
relaxed if some pairs of parties share authentication keys. That is,
costly communication links can be replaced by authentication keys.
In this work, we continue this line of research. We consider the
scenario where there is a specific sender and a specific receiver.
In this case, the protocol of [1] has n O(n) rounds even if there is
a single Byzantine processor. We present a more efficient proto­col 
with round complexity of (n=t) O(t) , where n is the number of
processors in the network and t is an upper bound on the number
of Byzantine processors in the network. Specifically, our protocol
is polynomial when the number of Byzantine processors is O(1),
and for every t its round complexity is bounded by 2 O(n) . The
same improvements hold for reliable and private communication.
The improved protocol is obtained by analyzing the properties of a
``communication and authentication graph'' that characterizes reliable 
communication.

"An Investigation of Marker-Passing Algorithms for Analogue Retrieval

e-mail: Michael.Wolverton@delab.sintef.no


Abstract. If analogy and case-based reasoning systems are to scale up
to very large case bases, it is important to analyze the various methods 
used for retrieving analogues to identify the features of the problem
for which they are appropriate. This paper reports on one such analysis, 
a comparison of retrieval by marker passing or spreading activation
in a semantic network with Knowledge-Directed Spreading Activation, a
method developed to be well-suited for retrieving semantically distant
analogues from a large knowledge base. The analysis has two complementary 
components: (1) a theoretical model of the retrieval time based
on a number of problem characteristics, and (2) experiments showing
how the retrieval time of the approaches varies with the knowledge base
size. These two components, taken together, suggest that KDSA is more
likely than SA to be able to scale up to retrieval in large knowledge bases.

Abstract. This paper describes a memory-based planning system. The
memory constitutes a collection of generalized plans, which we call skeletons. 
Each skeleton embodies a style, and organizes planning knowledge
in a packaging hierarchy. Traversal of this hierarchy results in hierarchical 
plan development, and the process is guided by a secondary memory
which organizes the properties of ingredients into an inheritance hierarchy. 
A simple indexing hierarchy allows access to each skeleton, which is
quite distinct and captures a whole class of plans in that style. Stepwise
refinement of the plan is accompanied by modifications which add ingredient 
specific steps on the way. A system has been implemented in the
culinary domain.

"Activating Case-Based Reasoning with Active Databases

Sheng Li and Qiang Yang

Abstract. Many of todays CBR systems are passive in nature: they
require human users to activate them manually and to provide information 
about the incoming problem explicitly. In this paper, we present an
integrated system that combines CBR system with an active database
system. Active databases, with the support of active rules, can perform
event detecting, condition monitoring, and event handling (action execution) 
in an automatic manner. The combined ActiveCBR system consists
of two layers. In the lower layer, the active database is rule-driven; in the
higher layer, the result of action execution of active rules is transformed
into feature-value pairs required by the CBR subsystem. The layered
architecture separates case-based reasoning from complicated rule-based
reasoning, and improves the traditional passive CBR system with the
active property. This paper shows how to construct ActiveCBR system
and provides an analysis of the resulting system architecture.

Abstract. Starting from the work of Matthew Dovey on analysing Rachmarinoffs 
piano performances using inductive logic programming, we
show how to apply the clausal discovery engine Claudien to induce theodes 
for predicting MIDI files from the musical analysis of a score.
This extends Doveys work in several directions: MIDI-encodings are used
instead of the older Ampico, a richer musical analysis within LaRues
SHMRG-model is applied, a much finer qualitative analysis of features
is learned (making it nearly quantitative), and predictions are made.
The application is not only relevant as yet another inductive logic programming 
benchmark, but also as a demonstration of the need for multiple 
predicate learning, sequence prediction and number handling in
inductive logic programming. Furthermore, the results presented here
can be considered the first original application of the clausal discovery
engine Claudien.

"Hybrid­Search and Storage of Semi­structured Information

Abstract
Given today's tangle of digital information, one of the hardest tasks for information
systems users is finding anything in the mess. For a number of well documented
reasons including the amazing growth in the Internet's popularity and the drop in
the cost of storage, the amount of information on the net, as well as on a user's local
computer has increased dramatically in recent years. Although this readily available
information should be extremely beneficial for computer users, paradoxically it is now
much harder to find anything.
Many different solutions have been proposed to the general information seeking
task of users, but few if any have addressed the needs of individuals or have leveraged
the benefit of single­user interaction. The Haystack project is an attempt to answer
the needs of the individual user. Creating such a system requires solving two problems.
Half the problem addresses the manipulation of the data into a queryable format.
Once the user's information is represented in Haystack, the other half of the problem
centers around our desire to answer the highly varied questions a user may ask about
this information. In this thesis we will propose a means of representing information
in a robust model within Haystack and we will describe a corresponding mechanism
by which the diverse questions of the individual can be answered. This novel method
functions by using a combination of existing information systems. We will call this
combined system a hybrid­search system.

Abstract. There is growing awareness of the need for recommender systems to
offer a more diverse choice of alternatives than is possible by simply retrieving
the cases that are most similar to a target query. Recent research has shown that
major gains in recommendation diversity can often be achieved at the expense
of relatively small reductions in similarity. However, there are many domains
in which it may not be acceptable to sacrifice similarity in the interest of
diversity. To address this problem, we examine the conditions in which
similarity can be increased without loss of diversity and present a new
approach to retrieval which is designed to deliver such similarity-preserving
increases in diversity when possible. We also present a more widely applicable
approach to increasing diversity in which the requirement that similarity is
fully preserved is relaxed to allow some loss of similarity, provided it is strictly
controlled.

"A Strong Complete Schema for Inductive Functional Logic Programming*

Abstract. A new IFLP schema is presented as a general framework for
the induction of functional logic programs (FLP). Since narrowing (which
is the most usual operational semantics of FLP) performs a unification
(mgu) followed by a replacement, we introduce two main operators in
our LFLP schema: a generalisation and an inverse replacement or intra-replacement, 
which results in a generic inversion of the transitive property of 
equality. We prove that this schema is strong complete in the way
that, given some evidence, it is possible to induce any program which
could have generated that evidence. We outline some possible restrictions 
in order to improve the tractability of the schema. We also show
that inverse narrowing is just a special case of our IFLP schema. Finally,
a straightforward extension of the IFLP schema to function invention is
illustrated.

Abstract. DIALOGS (Dialogue-based Inductive and Abductive LOGic
program Synthesizer) is a schema-guided synthesizer of recursive logic
programs; it takes the initiative and queries a (possibly computationally
naive) specifier for evidence in her/his conceptual language. The specifier
must know the answers to such simple queries, because otherwise s/he
wouldnt even feel the need for the synthesized program. DIALOGS can be
used by any learner (including itself) that detects, or merely conjectures,
the necessity of invention of a new predicate. Due to its foundation on a
powerful codification of a recursion-theory (by means of the template
and constraints of a divide-and-conquer schema), DIALOGS needs very
little evidence and is very fast.

Abstract. We discuss the problem of classification using the first order 
hypotheses. This paper proposes an enhancement of classification
based on the naive Bayesian scheme that is able to overcome the conditional 
independence assumption. Several experiments, involving some
artificial and real-world, both propositional and relational domains, were
conducted. The results indicate that the classification performance of
propositional learners is reached when the richer first-order knowledge
representation is not mandatory. This holds also in the domains where
such representation is more convenient. Our framework can also benefit
from the use of the hypotheses describing negative information. In such
case, the classification becomes more noise resistant.

Abstract. The development of an automatic image classification system is a
hard problem since such a system must imitate the visual strategy of a human
expert when interpreting the particular image. Usually it is not easy to make this
strategy explicit. Rather than describing the visual strategy and the image
features human are able to judge the similarity between the objects. This
judgement can be the basis for a guideline of the development process. This
guideline can help the developer to understand what kind of case
description/features are necessary for a sufficient system performance and can
give an idea what system performance can be achieved. In the paper we
describe a novel strategy which can support a developer in building image
classification systems. The development process as well as the elicitation of the
case description is similarity-guided. Based on the similarity between the
objects the system developer can provide new image features and improve the
system performance until a system performance is reached that fits to the
experts understanding about the relationship among the different objects.

Abstract. Since assigning indicies to textual cases is very time-consuming and
can impede the development of CBR systems, methods to automate the task are
desirable. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach that helps to boot-strap 
the development of a larger case base from a small collection of marked-up
case summaries. It uses the marked-up sentences as training examples to induce a
classifier that labels incoming cases whether an indexing concept applies. We illustrate 
how domain knowledge and linguistic information can be integrated with
a machine learning algorithm to improve performance. The paper presents experimental 
results which indicate the usefulness of learning from sentences and adding
a thesaurus. We also consider the chances and limitations of leveraging the learned
classifiers for full-text documents.

"Learning to Refine Indexing by Introspective Reasoning*

Abstract. A significant problem for case-based reasoning (CBR) systems is determining 
the features to use in judging case similarity for retrieval. We describe
research that addresses the feature selection problem by using introspective reasoning 
to learn new features for indexing. Our method augments the CBR system
with an introspective reasoning component which monitors system performance
to detect poor retrievals, identifies features which would lead retrieval of more
adaptable cases, and refines the indexing criteria to include the needed features
to avoid future failures. We explore the benefit of introspective reasoning by performing 
empirical tests on the implemented system. These tests examine the effect
of introspective index refinement, and the effects of problem order on case and index 
learning, and show that introspective learning of new index features improves
performance across the different problem orders.

Abstract

Tabu search is an established heuristic optimisation technique for problems where
exact algorithms are not available. It belongs to the same family as simulated
annealing or genetic algorithms. It extends the basic iterative improvement scheme by
adding control learning. A technique of this kind, intensification, captures experience
established on a frequency-based analysis of past search. Experience is reused while
the same optimisation process is going on in order to guide search to better solutions.
In this paper, we introduce a case-based reasoning approach for control learning in
tabu search. Search experience concerns operator selection and is represented by cases.
The aim of case reuse is to improve conflict resolution. While the proposed method is
domain independent, we present its application to the NP-hard uncapacitated facility
location problem. Experimental results show that adding our approach to a basic tabu
search optimisation significantly improves solution quality on the evaluated
benchmark problems. It reduces the gap to the optimal solution by a factor of nearly 2.

Abstract. Inductive logic programming systems usually send large numbers 
of queries to a database. The lattice structure from which these
queries are typically selected causes many of these queries to be highly
similar. As a consequence, independent execution of all queries may involve 
a lot of redundant computation. We propose a mechanism for executing 
a hierarchically structured set of queries (a query pack) through
which a lot of redundancy in the computation is removed. We have incorporated 
our query pack execution mechanism in the JLP systems TILDE
and WARMR by implementing a new Prolog engine JLPROLOG which provides 
support for pack execution at a lower level. Experimental results
demonstrate significant efficiency gains. Our query pack execution mechanism 
is very general in nature and could be incorporated in most other
ILP systems, with similar efficiency improvements to be expected.

Abstract. Cases are descriptions of situations limited in time and space. The
research reported here introduces a method for representation and reasoning
with time-dependent situations, or temporal cases, within a knowledge-intensive
 CBR framework. Most current CBR methods deal with snapshot
cases, descriptions of a world state at a single time stamp. In many time-dependent 
situations, value sets at particular time points are less important than
the value changes over some interval of time. Our focus is on prediction
problems for avoiding faulty situations. Based on a well-established theory of
temporal intervals, we have developed a method for representing temporal
cases inside the knowledge-intensive CBR system Creek. The paper presents
the theoretical foundation of the method, the representation formalism and basic
reasoning algorithms, and an example applied to the prediction of unwanted
events in oil well drilling.

"Information­Theoretic Private Information Retrieval: A Unified Construction

Amos Beimel  Yuval Ishai y
February 9, 2001

Abstract
A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database
while hiding the identity of the item being retrieved. In a t­private, k­server PIR protocol the database is
replicated among k servers, and the user's privacy is protected from any collusion of up to t servers. The
main cost­measure of such protocols is the communication complexity of retrieving a single bit of data.
This work addresses the information­theoretic setting for PIR, in which the user's privacy should be
unconditionally protected from collusions of servers. We present a unified general construction, whose
abstract components can be instantiated to yield both old and new families of PIR protocols. A main
ingredient in the new protocols is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam to a
communication complexity problem in the so­called simultaneous messages model.
Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and resolves some previous anoma­
lies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t­private k­server PIR protocols with communication O(n 1=b(2k 1)=tc ),
where n is the database size. For t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic improvement over the previous
state of the art; (2) a constant­factor improvement in the communication complexity of 1­private PIR,
providing the first improvement to the 2­server case since PIR protocols were introduced; (3) efficient
PIR protocols with logarithmic query length. The latter protocols have applications to the construction
of efficient families of locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR protocols with reduced
work by the servers.

Abstract
A crucial problem in rule­based machine translation is the acquisition of translation knowledge. Many
studies have been conducted for automatic acquisition in the past, but they require a great deal of
annotated examples. In this paper, we describe a semi­automatic acquisition from translation examples in
Japanese­Chinese environment. Whenever necessary, the process interacts with a user (a linguist) who
will provides additional information and constraints for generalizing the translation examples. The semi­-automatic 
approach is more efficient in the sense that less examples are required than automatic
approaches. Once the acquired knowledge is integrated with an MT system, we observe an improvement
in translation quality.

Abstract
We examine applications of clustering to the filtering
task. We use the on­line version of the star algorithm
[JPR98, JPR99] as the clustering tool because this algo­rithm 
computes, with high precision, naturally occuring
topics in a collection and it admits an eficient on­line so­lution 
for dynamic corpora. We describe several filtering
algorithms and show extensive experimental results using
the TREC collection.

"Local Predictions for Case-Based Plan Recognition

Abstract. This paper presents a novel case-based plan recognition system that
interprets observations of plan behavior using a case library of past
observations. The system is novel in that it represents a plan as a sequence of
action-state pairs rather than a sequence of actions preceded by some initial
state and followed by some final goal state. The system utilizes a unique
abstraction scheme to represent indices into the case base. The paper examines
and evaluates three different methods for prediction. The first method is
prediction without adaptation; the second is predication with adaptation, and the
third is prediction with heuristics. We show that the first method is better than a
baseline random prediction, that the second method is an improvement over the
first, and that the second and the third methods combined are the best overall
strategy.

Abstract. We present a logical approach to graph theoretical learning 
that is based on using alphabetic substitutions for modelling graph
morphisms. A classified graph is represented by a definite clause that
possesses variables of the sort node for representing nodes and atoms for
representing the edges. In contrast to the standard logical semantics, different 
node variables are assumed to denote different objects. The use of
an alphabetical subsumption relation (a-subsumption) implies that the
least generalization of clauses (a-generalization) has different properties
than Plotkins least generalization (lgg). We present a method for constructing 
optimal a-generalizations from Plotkins least generalization.
The developed framework is used in the relational decision tree algorithm
TRITOP.

ABSTRACT                                                                    
This paper describes a framework for integrating non-speech audio to hierarchical menu structures where the visual feedback
is limited. In the rst part of this paper, emphasis is put on how to extract sound design principles from actual navigation
problems. These design principles are then applied in the second part, through the design, implementation and evaluation of a
set of sounds in a computer-based simulation of the Nokia 6110 mobile phone. The evaluation indicates that non-speech sound
improves the performance of navigational tasks in terms of the number of errors made and the number of keypresses taken to
complete the given tasks. This study provides both theoretical and practical insights about the design of audio cues intended to
support navigation in complex menu structures.

"Generating Numerical Literals During Refinement

Abstract. Despite the rapid emergence and success of Inductive Logic
Programming, problems still surround number handlingproblems directly 
inherited from the choice of logic programs as the representation
language. Our conjecture is that a generalisation of the representation
language to Constraint Logic Programs provides an effective solution to
this problem. We support this claim with the presentation of an algorithm 
called NUM, to which a top-down refinement operator can delegate 
the task of finding numerical literals. NUM can handle equations,
in-equations and dis-equations in a uniform way, and, furthermore, provides 
more generality than competing approaches since numerical literals
are not required to cover all the positive examples available.

Abstract
In information retrieval research, precision and recall have long been used to evaluate IR systems. However, given that
a number of retrieval systems resembling one another are already available to the public, it is valuable to retrieve novel
relevant documents, i.e., documents that cannot be retrieved by those existing systems. In view of this problem, we
propose an evaluation method that favors systems retrieving as many novel documents as possible. We also used our
method to evaluate systems that participated in the IREX workshop.

Abstract. Current speech recognition systems can be categorized into
two broad classes; the knowledge-based approach and the stochastic one.
In this paper we present a rule-based method for the recognition of Hungarian 
vowels. A spectrogram model was used as a front-end module
and some acoustic features were extracted (e.g. locations, intensities and
shapes of local maxima) from spectrograms by using a genetic algorithm
method. On the basis of these features we developed a rule set for the
recognition of isolated Hungarian vowels. These rules represented by Prolog 
clauses were refined by the IMPUT Inductive Logic Programming
method.

Abstract. Estuaries are complex natural water systems. Their behaviour depend
on many factors, which are possible to analyse only by adopting different study
approaches. The physical processes within estuaries, such as floods and
pollutant dispersion, are generally investigated through computer modelling. In
this paper the application of case-based reasoning technology to support the
design of estuarine models is described. The system alms to provide a non-expert 
user in modelling with the necessary guidance for selecting a model that
matches his goal and the nature of the problem to be solved. The system is
based on three components: a case-based reasoning scheme, a genetic algorithm
and a library of numerical estuarine models. An example based on the Upper
Milford Haven estuary (UK) is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the systems
structure for supporting estuarmne model design.

Abstract. This paper describes an innovative application of Case-Based
Reasoning methodologies for the dynamic management of wireless
telecommunications systems. In spite of the very dynamic nature of mobile
communications, wireless networks only possess limited adaptive management
capabilities, which are unable to adequately follow traffic fluctuations through
flexible and real-time resource assignment reconfigurations. The study
described in this paper is an attempt to improve over these limitations, by
allowing wireless networks to alleviate the effects of traffic overloads through
an automated reasoning about its performance levels and an on-the-fly
reconfiguration of resources assignment. The proposed Case-Based Reasoning
approach provides a suitable framework to define a simple and scalable solution
that easily incorporates the preferences of the network operators.

Abstract. We study the problem of inducing normal programs of multiple 
predicates in the empirical ILP setting. We identify a class of normal
logic programs that can be handled and induced in a top-down manner
by an intensional system. We propose an algorithm called NMPL that
improves the multiple predicate learning system MPL and extends its
language from definite to this class of normal programs. Finally, we discuss 
the cost of the MPLs refinement algorithm and present theoretical
and experimental results showing that NMPL can be as effective as MPL
and is computationaily cheaper than it.

Abstract. We present and analyze the star clustering algorithm. We
discuss an implementation of this algorithm that supports browsing and
document retrieval through information organization. We define three
parameters for evaluating a clustering algorithm to measure the topic
separation and topic aggregation achieved by the algorithm. In the ab­sence 
of benchmarks, we present a method for randomly generating clus­tering 
data. Data from our user study shows evidence that the star al­gorithm 
is effective for organizing information.

Abstract
In a previous paper (Wolfe, Schreiner, Rehder, Laham, Foltz, Kintsch &
Landauer, this issue) we have shown how Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
can be used to assess student knowledge ­ how essays can be graded by LSA
and how LSA can match students with appropriate instructional texts. We did
this by comparing an essay written by a student with one or more target
instructional texts in terms of the cosine between the vector representation of
the student's essay and the instructional text in question. This simple method
was effective for the purpose, but questions remain about how LSA achieves
it's results and how they might be improved. Here we address four such
questions: (a) what role use of technical vocabulary per se plays, (b) how long
should the student essays be, (c) whether the cosine is optimal measure of
semantic relatedness, and (d) how to deal with the directionality of
knowledge in the high­dimensional space.

Abstract. A case-based reasoning system can produce both a solution and
an estimate of the confidence in that solution. The confidence value can be
used to determine whether the solution does or does not have the needed
accuracy. A statistical method can be used to compute a confidence value
from information generated during the case-based reasoning process. This
confidence value allows users to know when the results of the system
should and should not be used.

Abstract
Providing appropriate cues to users when interacting with objects in immersive virtual 
environments (IVEs) is a difficult task. In addition to individual user differences, environmental 
factors, and task-specific requirements, the technological complexity of the current state of the art 
in haptic feedback further increases the difficulty. Though the technology continues to improve, 
we are still a long way from having haptic feedback that meets the demands of a ""general 
solution"" to the problem. This paper focuses on ways of providing effective contact cues in IVEs, 
starting with purely-visual approaches and moving along a continuum to the use of actual physical 
objects as high-fidelity interfaces.

Abstract:
In order to maintain complex technical systems e.g. a telecommunication network, a rapid and
precise recognition of faults and critical situations is required. But the large number of different
components, the high degree of interdependencies among the components and the permanent
changes in these systems make the diagnosis of faults and critical situations difficult.
Case-based Reasoning (CBR) seems particularly well suited for such a diagnosis. The ability to
reuse old experiences by adapting them to current needs offers a possibility to handle the large
number of diagnoses as well as the changes in the systems. However, the large number of
components results in the problem of diagnosing multiple independent faults which leads to
serious difficulties in retrieval and adaptation.
This paper focuses on the specific problems of diagnosing multiple independent faults. An
incremental retrieval and adaptation approach based on an hypothesis and test strategy is
introduced which is able to cope with data of multiple overlapping problems. At the end of this
paper is given a report about the experiences in using the described algorithm for handling
multiple faults in telecommunication networks.

ABSTRACT                                                  
The sound received at the ears is processed by humans using signal-processing 
that separates the signal along intensity, pitch and timbre 
dimensions.  Conventional Fourier-based signal processing,                   
while endowed with fast algorithms, is unable to easily represent                
signal along these attributes. In this paper we use a recently proposed 
cortical representation to represent and manipulate sound.                 
We brießy overview algorithms for obtaining, manipulating and                    
inverting cortical representation of a sound and describe algorithms             
for manipulating signal pitch and timbre separately. The algorithms 
are Þrst used to create sound of an instrument between a                  
guitar and a trumpet. Applications to creating maximally separable 
sounds in auditory user interfaces are discussed.

Abstract. This paper describes a case-based approach to user profiling in a Personal 
Travel Assistant (based on the 1998 FIPA Travel Scenario). The approach 
is novel in that the user profile is made up of a set of cases capturing
previous interactions rather than as a single composite case. This has the advantage 
that the profile is always up-to-date and also allows for the borrowing of
cases from similar users when coverage is poor. Profile data is retrieved from a
database in an XML format and loaded into a case-retrieval net in memory.
This case-retrieval net is then used to support the two key tasks of requirements
elaboration and ranking offers.

ABSTRACT
Indexing and content­based retrieval are necessary to handle the
large amounts of audio and multimedia data that is becoming avail­able 
on the web and elsewhere. Since manual indexing using ex­isting 
audio editors is extremely time consuming a number of au­tomatic 
content analysis systems have been proposed. Most of
these systems rely on speech recognition techniques to create text
indices. On the other hand, very few systems have been proposed
for automatic indexing of music and general audio. Typically these
systems rely on classification and similarity­retrieval techniques
and work in restricted audio domains.
A somewhat different, more general approach for fast indexing
of arbitrary audio data is the use of segmentation based on multi­ple 
temporal features combined with automatic or semi­automatic
annotation. In this paper, a general methodology for audio seg­mentation 
is proposed. A number of experiments were performed
to evaluate the proposed methodology and compare different seg­mentation 
schemes. Finally, a prototype audio browsing and an­notation 
tool based on segmentation combined with existing clas­sification 
techniques was implemented.

Abstract
We present three scalable extensions of the star algorithm for information organization that use
sampling. The star algorithm organizes a document collection into clusters that are naturally induced
by the topic structure of collection, via a computationally efficient cover by dense subgraphs. We
also provide supporting data from extensive experiments.

ABSTRACT
A quantitative analysis of a large collection of expert­rated
web sites reveals that page­level metrics can accurately pre­dict 
if a site will be highly rated. The analysis also pro­vides 
empirical evidence that important metrics, including
page composition, page formatting, and overall page char­acteristics, 
differ among web site categories such as educa­tion, 
community, living, and finance. These results provide
an empirical foundation for web site design guidelines and
also suggest which metrics can be most important for evaluation 
via user studies.

ABSTRACT                                                      
We present seven diverse augmented reality interfaces                                                               
including audio tunnels from a virtual environment to fixed   
and mobile phones; digital activity meters for locating       
hotspots of activity in a parallel virtual world; a tripod   
mounted display for small groups to view virtual events;                                                            
and public projections of shadows and sound from a virtual  
world. An analys is of how these match different design     
goals and real world constraints demonstrates the potential 
utility of each. We explore how the use of a shared         
underlying virtual world enables multiple interfaces such as
these to be coordinated to provide a rich and coherent 
augmented reality experience.

Abstract. In this paper we present an algorithm called DerUCP, which
can be regarded as a general model for plan adaptation using Derivational 
Analogy. Using DerUCP, we show that previous results on the
complexity of plan adaptation do not apply to Derivational Analogy. We
also show that Derivational Analogy can potentially produce exponential 
reductions in the size of the search space generated by a planning
system.

Abstract
We derive general bounds on the complexity of learning in the Statistical Query (SQ) model
and in the PAC model with classification noise. We do so by considering the problem of boosting
the accuracy of weak learning algorithms which fall within the SQ model. This new model was
introduced by Kearns to provide a general framework for efficient PAC learning in the presence
of classification noise.
We first show a general scheme for boosting the accuracy of weak SQ learning algorithms,
proving that weak SQ learning is equivalent to strong SQ learning. The boosting is efficient and
is used to show our main result of the first general upper bounds on the complexity of strong
SQ learning. Since all SQ algorithms can be simulated in the PAC model with classification
noise, we also obtain general upper bounds on learning in the presence of classification noise for
classes which can be learned in the SQ model.

"A Case Retention Policy Based on Detrimental Retrieval

Abstract. This paper presents a policy to retain new cases based on
retrieval benefits for case-based planning (CBP). After each case-based
problem solving episode, an analysis of the adaptation effort is made to
evaluate the guidance provided by the retrieved cases. If the guidance is
determined to be detrimental, the obtained solution is retain as a new
case in the case base. Otherwise, if the retrieval is beneficial, the case base
remains unchanged. We will observe that the notion of adaptable cases is
not adequate to address the competence of a case base in the context of
CBP. Instead, we claim that the notion of detrimental retrieval is more
adequate. We compare our retain policy against two policies in the CBP
literature and claim that our policy to retain cases based on the benefits
is more effective. Our claim is supported by empirical validation.

Abstract. This paper details the way case-based reasoning has been
used to aid footwear designers in creating new designs while maximizing
component reuse. A hybrid system was created which uses an object-oriented 
memory model, neural networks for retrieval and fuzzy feature
vectors to augment the basic case-based reasoning model. One of the
main tasks involved in the design of any case-based system is determining
the features that make up a case and finding a way to index these cases
in a case-base for efficient and correct retrieval. This paper looks at the
components of this footwear design system and how the various elements
join together to create a useful system, in particular, how the use of
fuzzy feature vectors and neural networks can improve the indexing and
retrieval steps in case-based systems.

Abstract. Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific
pieces of experience, the reasoners or anothers, that can be used to
solve problems. We use the term graph-structured for representations
that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects
in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case
and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary
to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for
example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some
logic.
We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, 
and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations 
efficiently. We make a case-based argument using examples from
two systems, CHIRON and CAPER, to show how a graph-structured representation 
supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two
different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured
representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, implemented
in CAPER.

useful in the analysis of parallel program performance.
this paper, four algorithms for finding the near±critical
paths of program activity graphs are presented and
compared, including an efficient new algorithm that utilizes
slack values calculated by the critical path method to
perform a best±first search in linear space.  The worst
case time and memory requirements of the new algorithm are in
O(ke) and O(k+e), where e is the number of edges in the
graph.  Results confirming the efficiency of the algorithm
are presented for five application programs.  A framework
for utilizing the near±critical path information is also described.
The framework includes both statistical summaries
and visualization capabilities.

"An Explicit Representation of Reasoning Failures

Michael T. Cox
Computer Science Department. Carnegie Mellon University

mcox@cs.cmu.edu


Abstract. This paper focuses upon the content and the level of granularity at which representations 
for the mental world should be placed in case-based explainers that employ
introspective reasoning. That is, for a case-based reasoning system to represent thinking
about the self, about the states and processes of reasoning, at what level of detail should
one attempt to declaratively capture the contents of thought? Some claim that a mere set of
two mental primitives are sufficient to represent the utterances of humans concerning
verbs of thought such as I forgot his birthday. Alternatively, many in the CBR community 
have built systems that record elaborate traces of reasoning, keep track of knowledge
dependencies or inference, or encode much metaknowledge concerning the structure of
internal rules and defaults. The position here is that a system should be able instead to capture 
enough details to represent causally a common set of reasoning failure symptoms. I
propose a simple model of expectation-driven reasoning, derive a taxonomy of reasoning
failures from the model, and present a declarative representation of the failure symptoms
that have been implemented in a CBR simulation. Such representations enable a system to
explain reasoning failures by mapping from symptoms of the failures to causal factors
involved.

Abstract. The main assumption underlying case-based reasoning is that
a problem with similar features as an earlier one is likely to have the same
solution. However, this assumption has never been formally justified, and
one can easily find practical situations where it is not true.
We use probablity theory to show that even if this fundamental assumption 
can be wrong for particular instances, it is guaranteed to be correct
on the average, and this no matter what the probability distributions
involved are. We define the concept of a match weight as a well-justified
measure of similarity. We show how it is often possible to effectively compute 
a lower bound on match weight. We report on the performance of
such bounds when used as a similarity measure in a simple example.

"Combining Statistical and Relational Methods for Learning in Hypertext Domains

Seán Slattery and Mark Craven

e-mail: <firstname>.<lastname>@cs.cmu.edu



Abstract. We present a new approach to learning hypertext classifiers
that combines a statistical text-learning method with a relational rule
learner. This approach is well suited to learning in hypertext domains
because its statistical component allows it to characterize text in terms
of word frequencies, whereas its relational component is able to describe
how neighboring documents are related to each other by hyperlinks that
connect them. We evaluate our approach by applying it to tasks that involve 
learning definitions for (i) classes of pages, (ii) particular relations
that exist between pairs of pages, and (iii) locating a particular class of
information in the internal structure of pages. Our experiments demonstrate 
that this new approach is able to learn more accurate classifiers
than either of its constituent methods alone.

"Integrating Semantic Structure and Technical Documentation in Case-Based Service Support Systems

Vogt-Kölln-Str. 30, 22527 Hamburg


Abstract. Help desk systems are one of the most successful application
areas of case-based reasoning. However, case-based reasoning techniques
cover only parts of the whole help desk scenario. One missing part is providing 
access to the technical docummentation. Combining these becomes
especially important in the area of service support systems, where the
service person has no access to the printed documentation. This paper
presents a concept how to integrate CBR and technical documentation
for service support systems.

Abstract. A new method is proposed for tuning rules by cases, especially in domains in
which precise and exceptionless rules are known to be unavailable. When the result of
execution of a rule is not satisfactory, the system stores the name of the executed rule, the
conditions under which the rule was executed, the evaluation of the execution, the attributes 
and values to be modified, and hypothesized alternatives, as a case. The next
time the rule is to be executed under the same conditions, the relevant attributes and
values are temporarily modified, by replacement by their hypothesized alternatives. After 
a certain number of such experiments, the maintainer of the system can reconstruct
the whole rule base by referring to the stored cases. This methodology is implemented as
a system, A LA CARTE, in the domain of cooking.

"1BC: A First-Order Bayesian Classifier

Peter Flach and Nicolas Lachiche

University of Bristol, United Kingdom
{flach,lachiche}@cs.bris.ac.uk



Abstract. In this paper we present iBO, a first-order Bayesian Classifier. 
Our approach is to view individuals as structured terms, and to distinguish 
between structural predicates referring to subterms (e.g. atoms
from molecules), and properties applying to one or several of these subterms (
e.g. a bond between two atoms). We describe an individual in
terms of elementary features consisting of zero or more structural predicates 
and one property; these features are considered conditionally independent 
following the usual naive Bayes assumption. 1BC has been implemented 
in the context of the first-order descriptive learner Tertius,
and we describe several experiments demonstrating the viability of our
approach.

Abstract. This paper provides an empirical study of an Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) method through the application to classifying ocular
fundus images for glaucoma diagnosis. Key issues in this study are not
only dealing with low-level measurement data such as image, but also
producing diagnostic rules that are readable and comprehensive for 
interactions to medical experts. For this purpose, we develop a 
constraint-directed ILP system, GKS, that handles both symbolic and numerical
data, and produce Horn clauses with numerical constraints. Furthermore,
we provide GKS with a sequential learning facility where GKS 
repeatedly generates a single best rule which becomes background knowledge
for the next learning phase. Since the learning target for this application
is the abnormality of each segment in image, generated rules represent
the relationships between abnormal segments. Since such relationships
can be interpreted as qualitative rules and be used as diagnostic rules 
directly, the present method provides automatic construction of knowledge
base from experts accumulated diagnostic experience. Furthermore, the
experimental result shows that induced rules have high statistical 
performance. The present study indicates the advantage and possibility of
the ILP approach to medical diagnosis from measurement data.

ABSTRACT
Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple
search engines in response to a given query, the problem of
metasearch is to combine these lists in a way which optimizes
the performance of the combination. This paper makes three
contributions to the problem of metasearch: (1) We describe
and investigate a metasearch model based on an optimal
democratic voting procedure, the Borda Count; (2) we de­
scribe and investigate a metasearch model based on Bayesian
inference; and (3) we describe and investigate a model for
obtaining upper bounds on the performance of metasearch
algorithms. Our experimental results show that metasearch
algorithms based on the Borda and Bayesian models usu­ally 
outperform the best input system and are competitive
with, and often outperform, existing metasearch strategies.
Finally, our initial upper bounds demonstrate that there is
much to learn about the limits of the performance of meta­
search.

"An Analogical Theory of Creativity in Design

Abstract. Creative design often involves large. complex modifications
to the design topology. Making these modifications typically requires
transfer of design configurations from different designs to the new problem. 
We describe an analogical theory of creative design called model-based 
analogy (MBA). In this theory, case-specific structure-behavior-function 
(SBF) models of past designs enable abstraction of generic
telelogical mechanisms (GTMs) at storage time. The goal of adapting
a specific design to address a new design problem leads to the retrieval
of a relevant GTM and its instantiation in the context of the case-specific
SBF model at transfer time. Thus GTMs learned from past designs mediate 
the transfer of abstract design configurations to a new problem.

Abstract. Many Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems are built using
the conventional database systems as their case memory. Even though
these Database Management Systems (DBMSs) provide a large number
of advantages, CBR systems developers face one major draw back. That
is, partial-match retrieval is not supported by most of the conventional
DBMSs. To overcome this limitation, we investigated contemporary research 
in CBR and Cooperative Query Answering (CQA). Our finding
indicates that there are a number of issues in CQA that can be solved by
applying some of the innovative techniques developed by the CBR community, 
on the other hand, the CQA provide a number of new features
which enable easy development of CBR systems. The main contribution
of this paper is in explicating how CBR can benefit from the CQA research, 
and how CQA techniques can enhance the CBR systems. Fürther,
it describes the CQA features in RICAD (Risk Cost Advisor, our experimental 
CBR system), and how these features enhance its performance.

"Reasoning with Reasons in Case-Based Comparisons

Kevin D. Ashley and Bruce M. McLaren
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260

Abstract. In this work, we are interested in how rational decision makers reason
with and about reasons in a domain, practical ethics, where they appear to reason
about reasons symbolically in terms of both abstract moral principles and case
comparisons. The challenge for reasoners, human and artificial, is to use abstract
knowledge of reasons and principles to inform decisions about the salience of
similarities and differences among cases while still accounting for a case's or
problems specific contextual circumstances. TRUTH-TELLER is a program we
have developed and tested that compares pairs of cases presenting ethical
dilemmas about whether to tell the truth. The programs methods for reasoning
about reasons help it to make context sensitive assessments of the salience of
similarities and differences.

Abstract. One of the most prominent approaches in Inductive Logic
Programming is the use of least generalizations under subsumption of
given clauses. However, subsumption is weaker than logical implication,
and not very well suited for handling recursive clauses. Therefore an
important open question in this area concerns the existence of least generalizations
 under implication (LGIs). Our main new result in this paper
is the existence and computability of such an LGI for any finite set of
clauses which contains at least one non-tautologous function-free clause.
We can also define implication relative to background knowledge. In this
case, least generalizations only exist in a very limited case.

"Learning Query Behavior in the Haystack System

Wendy S. Chien
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY


Abstract
Haystack is a personalized information retrieval system that allows users to store,
maintain, and query for information. This thesis describes how learning is added
to the system so that when a user makes a query on a topic similar to a previous
query, the system can use the relevance feedback information from before to provide
an improved result set for the current query. The learning module was designed to
be modular and extensible so more sophisticated learning algorithms and techniques
can be easily implemented in the future. Testing of our system showed that learning
based on relevance feedback somewhat improved the results of the queries.

Abstract. In this paper, we consider learning first-order Horn programs
from entailment. In particular, we show that any subclass of first-order
acyclic Horn programs with constant arity is exactly learnable from
equivalence and entailment membership queries provided it allows a
polynomial-time subsumption procedure and satisfies some closure conditions. 
One consequence of this is that first-order acyclic determinate
Horn programs with constant arity are exactly learnable from equivalence 
and entailment membership queries.

"Virtual Function Generators: Representing and Reusing Underlying Design Concepts in Conceptual Synthesis of Mechanisms for Function Generation

Abstract. This paper describes an approach to represent and reuse efficiently
the underlying design concepts in the existing mechanisms in order to synthesize 
mechanisms for function-generation and motion-transmission. A notion of
virtual function generator is introduced to conceptualize and represent all possible 
underlying design concepts in the existing mechanisms. The virtual function 
generators are extracted from the existing mechanisms and composed of
one or more primitive mechanisms together with the involved functions. They
serve as new conceptual building blocks in the conceptual synthesis of design
alternatives. The whole design concept or sub-concepts of the mechanisms can
be represented and reused efficiently by the notion of virtual function generator.
New mechanisms are generated by extracting and combining the underlying
design concepts via the virtual function generators. The capability of the proposed 
approach is illustrated with a design example.

Abstract. Case-based reasoning depends on multiple knowledge sources
beyond the case library, including knowledge about case adaptation and
criteria for similarity assessment. Because hand coding this knowledge
accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing 
CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is
a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing 
case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. 
However, despite early interest in case-based approaches
to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open
questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should
be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require,
and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through
a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by
a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation 
and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations
and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based
CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly
demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources.
The paper closes with general lessons about case-based CBR and areas
for future research.

Abstract. The similarity measures used in first-order IBL so far have
been limited to the function-free case. In this paper we show that a lot of
predictive power can be gained by allowing lists and other terms in the
input representation and designing similarity measures that work directly
on these structures. We present an improved similarity measure for the
first-order instance based learner RIBL that employs the concept of edit
distances to efficiently compute distances between lists and terms, discuss
its computational and formal properties, and show that it is empirically
superior by a wide margin on a problem from the domain of biochemistry.

"A Practical Clustering Algorithm for Static and Dynamic Information Organization \Lambda

Dartmouth College y

Abstract
We present and analyze the off­line star algorithm for clus­tering 
static information systems and the on­line star algo­rithm 
for clustering dynamic information systems. These
algorithms organize a document collection into a number of
clusters that is naturally induced by the collection via a com­putationally 
efficient cover by dense subgraphs. We further
show a lower bound on the accuracy of the clusters produced
by these algorithms as well as demonstrate that these algo­rithms 
are efficient (running times roughly linear in the size
of the problem). Finally, we provide data from a number of
experiments.

Abstract - A case-based reasoning system for determining what colorants
to use for producing a specific color of plastic was created. The selection of
colorants needs to take many factors into consideration. A technique that
involved fuzzy logic was used to compare the quality of the color match for
each factor. The system has been in use for two years at a growing number
of GE Plastics sites and has shown significant cost savings.

This paper presents a general model for sonification of large spatial data sets (e.g. seismic data, medical data) based on ideas
from ecological acoustics. The model incorporates not only what we hear (the sounds), but also how we listen (the
interaction). Metaphorically speaking the interpreter is walking along paths in areas of the data set, listening to locally and
globally defined sound objects. The time aspects of sonification are given special attention, introducing the notion of
temporalization. Some features of a preliminary Windows NT implementation are summarized.

"Similarity Metrics: A Formal Unification of Cardinal and Non-Cardinal Similarity Measures

Hugh Osborne and Derek Bridge

University of York
U.K.


Abstract. In [9] we introduced a formal framework for constructing
ordinal similarity measures, and suggested how this might also be applied
to cardinal measures. In this paper we will place this approach in a more
general framework, called similarity metrics. In this framework, ordinal
similarity metrics (where comparison returns a boolean value) can be
combined with cardinal metrics (returning a numeric value) and, indeed,
with metrics returning values of other types, to produce new metrics.

Irene Weber

Institut für Informatik, Universität Stuttgart,
Breitwiesenstr. 2022, 70565 Stuttgart, Germany
email: Irene.Weber@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de



Abstract. In this paper, we present an algorithm for the discovery of first order 
clauses holding in an relational database in the framework of the nonmonotonic 
ILP setting [1]. The algorithm adopts the principle of offline candidate
determination algorithm used for mining association rules in large transaction
databases [4]. Analoguous to the measures used in mining association rules, we
define a support and a confidence measure as acceptance criteria for discovered
hypothesis clauses.
The algorithm has been implemented in C with an interface to the relational
database management system INGRES. We present and discuss the results of
an experiment in the KRK domain and conclude.

"Fish and Sink An Anytime-Algorithm to Retrieve Adequate Cases

Jörg Walter Schaaf

GMD - Artificial Intelligence Research Division
e-mail:Joerg.Schaaf@gmd.de
Sankt Augustin, Germany


Abstract. The main idea of the presented approach is based on the
observation that identical data can be interpreted and used differently
in different situations and by different persons. Data is considered individually 
and according to the actual situation. This phenomena can
be interpreted as regarding different aspects. Here, the notion of aspects
is applied to cases in the area of Cased Based Reasoning. This requires
special representation of cases, special structure of case bases and a new
algorithm to work on the defined structure. In this paper we will focus
on description and discussion of an anytime algorithm that searches for
cases regarding the relevant aspects.

Abstract. A key concept in case-based reasoning is similarity. In this
paper, we first propose a similarity measure for structured representations 
that is based on graph edit operations. Then we show how this
similarity measure can be computed by means of state space search. Subsequently, 
subgraph isomorphism is considered as a special case of graph
similarity and a new efficient algorithm for its detection is proposed.
The new algorithm is particularly suitable if there is a large number of
library cases being tested against an input graph. Finally, we present experimental 
results showing the computational efficiency of the proposed
approach.

"A Method for Predicting Solutions in Case-Based Problem Solving

Eyke Hüllermeier

Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse
Université Paul Sabatier
eyke@irit.fr



Abstract. In order to predict the solution to a new problem we proceed
from the similar problemsimilar solution assumption underlying case-based 
reasoning. The concept of a similarity hypothesis is introduced as
a formal model of this meta-heuristic. It allows for realizing a constraint-based 
inference scheme which derives a prediction in the form of a set
of possible candidates. We propose an algorithm for learning a suitable
similarity hypothesis from a sequence of observations. Basing the inference 
process on hypotheses thus defined yields (set-valued) predictions
that cover the true solution with high probability. Our method is meant
to support the overall (case-based) problem solving process by bringing
a promising set of possible solutions into focus.

An important problematic issue with general
semantic lexicons like WordNet or GermaNet
is that they do not cover many terms and
concepts specific to certain domains.
Therefore, these resources need to be tuned to
a specific domain at hand. This involves
selecting those senses that are most
appropriate for the domain, as well as
extending the sense inventory with novel
terms and novel senses that are specific to the
domain. In this paper we focus on extending
GermaNet synsets with domain specific terms,
taking into account the domain relevance of
senses (i.e. synsets).

"Experiments On Adaptation-Guided Retrieval In Case-Based Design

Abstract. Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been applied with some success to
complex planning and design tasks. In such systems, the best case is retrieved and
adapted to solve a particular target problem. Often, the best case is that which can
be most easily adapted to the target problem (as the overhead in adaptation is
generally very high). Standard CBR systems use semantic-similarity to retrieve
cases, on the assumption that the most similar case is the easiest case to adapt.
However, this assumption can be shown to be flawed. In this paper, we report a
novel retrieval method, called adaptation-guided retrieval, that is sensitive to the
ease-of-adaptation of cases. In the context of a CBR system for software-design,
called Déjà Vu, we show through a series of experiments that adaptation-guided
retrieval is more accurate than standard retrieval techniques, that it scales well to
large case-bases and that it results in more efficient overall problem-solving
performance. The implications of this method and these results are discussed.

Abstract. This paper discusses a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach 
as a good way of incrementally improving an information retrieval
strategy. The proposed approach, Cabri-n, achieves a synergy between
CBR and information retrieval that aims to exploit users feedback for improving 
the retrieval short-term performances (during a single retrieval
session) and the long-term performances (over the systems life time).
The long-term improvement is achieved by managing a memory of sessions 
which exploits successes as well as failures of information retrieval.
A typology defined over the set of potential information needs serves as
a meta-index for the long-term memory, so allows a context-sensitive retrieval 
and adaptation of former sessions. Besides, we discuss some common 
issues of CBR and information retrieval making their combination
a promising paradigm.

"A Multivalued Conditional Logic with Probabilistic Interpretation for Causal Decision Theory

Causal decision theory has been developed to deal with rational decision making in the case
where making a decision may be seen as an indication that some outcome will obtain. It has
been suggested that counterfactual conditionals should be used in such a decision situation. The
crucial problem posed is that of calculating the probability of a counterfactual conditional. The
only technique available until now is imaging which, however, only applies to a restricted
structure of possible worlds. In order to make the causal decision theory applicable to the
general case, in this paper, we extend the imaging technique to the general structure. This
results in a logic in which counterfactual conditionals are multivalued. We further provide a
probabilistic interpretation to this logic.

Abstract. This paper describes the dual use of a case base for diagnosis
and for improving the design of a manufacturing process. In the short
term, the case base is used to provide past experience in dealing with
similar problems during the manufacture of aluminum components. In
the longer term, it is used to feed that experience into the design of the
manufacturing process for new components.
This is achieved by having a case hase of previous manufacturing process
problems and solutions. For diagnosis, case base matching is done in a
fairly straightforward manner. In order to use the cases in design analysis,
the case information about process type and problems with a particular
process is fed into a process failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA),
and provides details of possible problems and their likelihood.

Abstract. In this paper, we present an in-depth evaluation of two 
approaches of extending k-means clustering to work on first-order 
representations. The first-approach, k-medoids, selects its cluster center from
the given set of instances, and is thus limited in its choice of centers. The
second approach, k-prototypes, uses a heuristic prototype construction
algorithm that is capable of generating new centers. The two approaches
are empirically evaluated on a standard benchmark problem with respect
to clustering quality and convergence. Results show that in this case 
indeed the k-medoids approach is a viable and fast alternative to existing
agglomerative or top-down clustering approaches even for a small-scale
dataset, while k-prototypes exhibited a number of deficiencies.

"Learning Unions of High Dimensional Boxes over the Reals

Amos Beimel  Eyal Kushilevitz y
Abstract

In [4] an algorithm is presented that exactly learns (using membership queries and equivalence
queries) several classes of unions of boxes in high dimension over finite discrete domains. The running
time of the algorithm is polynomial in the logarithm of the size of the domain and other parameters
of the target function (in particular, the dimension). We go one step further and present a PAC+MQ
algorithm whose running time is independent of the size of the domain. Thus, we can learn such classes
of boxes over infinite domains. Specifically, we learn unions of t disjoint n-dimensional boxes over the
reals in time polynomial in n and t, and unions of O(log n) (possibly intersecting) n-dimensional boxes
over the reals in time polynomial in n.

Abstract. Probabilistic models provide a sound and coherent foundation 
for dealing with the noise and uncertainty encountered in most realworld domains. 
Bayesian networks are a language for representing complex 
probabilistic models in a compact and natural way. A Bayesian
network can be used to reason about any attribute in the domain, given
any set of observations. It can thus be used for a variety tasks, including
prediction, explanation, and decision making. The probabilistic semantics 
also gives a strong foundation for the task of learning models from
data. Techniques currently exist for learning both the structure and the
parameters, for dealing with missing data and hidden variables, and for
discovering causal structure.
One of the main limitations of Bayesian networks is that they represent
the world in terms of a fixed set of attributes . Like propositional logic,
they are incapable of reasoning explicitly about entities, and thus cannot
represent models over domains where the set of entities and the relations
between them are not fixed in advance. As a consequence, Bayesian networks 
are limited in their ability to model large and complex domains.
Probabilistic relational models are a language for describing probabilistic 
models based on the significantly more expressive basis of relational
logic. They allow the domain to be represented in terms of entities, their
properties, and the relations between them. These models represent the
uncertainty over the properties of an entity, representing its probabilistic
dependence both on other properties of that entity and on properties of
related entities. They can even represent uncertainty over the relational
structure itself. Some of the techniques for Bayesian network learning
can be generalized to this setting, but the learning problem is far from
solved. Probabilistic relational models provide a new framework, and new
challenges, for the endeavor of learning relational models for real-world
domains.

"Beyond the Query-By-Example Paradigm: New Query Interfaces for Music Information Retrieval

Abstract
The majority of existing work in music information retrieval
for audio signals has followed the content-based 
query-by-example paradigm. In this paradigma musical
piece is used as a query and the result is a list of    
other musical pieces ranked by their content similarity.
In this paper we describe algorithms and graphical      
user interfaces that enable novel alternative ways for      
querying and browsing large audio collections. Computer
audition algorithms are used to extract content      
information from audio signals. This automatically extracted
information is used to configure the graphical       
user interfaces and to genereate new query audio signals
for browsing and retrieval.

This paper describes a new approach to render sonifications for high-dimensional data,
allowing the user to perceive the main structure of the data distribution. This is achieved 
by computing the principal curve of the data set, which is a trajectory that asses through
the middle of the data and allows to de nea time order on the data points. The sonification
can be imagined as the time-variant auditory scene, perceived while moving along the principal
curve. In this paper a method for computing principal curves is presented, the sonification
concept is introduced and some sonification examples are given.

ABSTRACT
The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently become the                
main source of digital information accessible everywhere        
and by everyone. Nevertheless, the inherent visual nature of    
Internet browsers makes the Web inaccessible to the             
visually impaired. To solve this problem, non-visual            
browsers have been developed. One of the new problems,          
however, with those non-visual browsers is that they often      
transform the visual content of HTML documents into             
textual information only, that can be restituted by a text-to-speech 
converter or a Braille device. The loss of spatial       
layout, and textual attributes such as boldface, italic,        
underline, color or even size should be avoided since they      
often bear visually important information. Moreover,            
typical non-visual Internet browsers do not allow visually      
impaired and sighted individuals to easily work together        
using the same environment. These new problems have to          
be solved with new alternative non-visual display               
techniques. This paper presents WebSound, a new generic          
Web sonification tool and its application to a 3D audio          
augmented Internet browser (Internet Explorer 5.0)               
developed at the University of Geneva.

Abstract. Software design patterns are used in software engineering as a way
to improve and maintain software systems. Patterns are abstract solutions to
problem categories, and they describe why, how, and when can a pattern be applied. 
Their description is based on natural language, which makes the automation 
of design patterns a difficult task. In this paper we present an approach for
automation of design pattern application. We focus on the selection of what
pattern to apply, and where to apply it. We follow a Case-Based Reasoning approach, 
providing a complete framework for pattern application. In our approach 
cases describe situations for application of patterns.

Abstract. The development of an Image Processing (IP) application is a complex 
activity, which can be greatly alleviated by user-friendly graphical programming 
environments. Our major objective is to help IP experts reuse parts of
their applications. A first work towards knowledge reuse has been to propose a
suitable representation of the strategies of IP experts by means of IP plans (trees
of tasks, methods and tools). This paper describes the CBR module of our interactive 
system for the development of IP plans. Mter a brief presentation of the
overall architecture of the system and its other modules, we explain the distinction 
between an IP case and an IP plan, and give the selection criteria and functions 
that are used for similarity calculation. The core of the CBR module is a
search/adaptation algorithm, whose main steps are detailed: retrieval of suitable
cases, recursive adaptation of the selected one and memorization of new cases.
The systems implementation is presently completed; its functioning is described 
in a session showing the kind of assistance provided by the CBR module
during the development of a new IP application.

ABSTRACT                                                                               
Patients with lack of proprioception are unable to build and maintain internal models of their limbs and monitor their limb
movements because these patients do not receive the appropriate information from muscles and joints.  This project was
undertaken to determine if auditory signals can provide proprioceptive information normally obtained through muscle and
joint receptors.  Sonification of spatial location and sonification of joint motion, for monitoring arm/hand motions, was
attempted in two pilot experiments with a patient.  Sonification of joint motion though strong time/synchronization cues was
the most successful approach.  These results are encouraging and suggest that auditory feedback of joint motions may be
substitute for proprioceptive input.  However, additional data will have to be collected and control experiments will have to
be done.

Abstract
The Internet is a tremendous resource where one can find documents to enrich a personal information space. The
question is: how can one find relevant documents and how can these be organized into an information space? In
this paper, we describe a prototype which aims to provide the user with assistance in these two tasks. Our
approach assumes the existence of an initial concept structure set up by the user. This structure may contain only
rudimentary descriptions for each concept. The system's task is to find relevant documents from the Internet and
to insert them in the appropriate places in the concept structure.

"Factors Influencing the Dimer to Monomer Transition of an Antibody Single-Chain

ABSTRACT:
Antibody single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments are able to form dimers under certa inconditions,                                
and the extent of dimerization appears to depend on linker length, antibody sequence, and external factors.             
We analyzed the factors influencing dimer- monomer equilibrium as well as the rate of interconversion,                  
using the scFv McPC603 as a model system. In this molecule, the stability of theHV- VL interaction can                  
be conveniently varied by adjusting the ionic strength (because of its influence on the hydrophobic effect),            
by pH (presumably because of the presence of titratable groups in the interface), and by the presence or                
absence of the antigen phosphorylcholine, which can be rapidly removed due to its very fast off-rate. It                
was found that the monomer is the thermodynamically stable form with linkers of 15 and 25 amino acids                   
length under all conditions tested (35íM or less). The dimer is initially formed in periplasmic expression,             
\presumably by domain swapping, and can be trapped by all factors which stabilize theH- VVL interface,                   
such as the presence of the antigen, high ionic strength, and pH below 7.5. Under all other conditions,                 
it converts to the monomer. Predominantly monomer is obtained during in vitro folding. Monomer is                       
stabilized against dimerization at very high concentrations by the same factors which stabilize theH- V                 
VL interaction.    These results should be helpful in producing molecules with defined oligomerization                  
states.

"Three Power­aware Routing Algorithms
for Sensor Networks

Abstract
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large wireless ad­hoc networks (es­pecially 
sensor networks) for applications where the message sequence is not known. We
seek to optimize the lifetime of the network. We show that online power­aware routing
does not have a constant competitive ratio to the o#­line optimal algorithm. We develop
an approximation algorithm called max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive
ratio. To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algorithm for power­aware rout­ing. 
This hierarchical algorithm is called zone­based routing. Our experiments show that
its performance is quite good. Finally, we describe a distributed version of this algorithm
that does not depend on any centralization.

"On the Automatic Generation of Case Libraries by Chunking Chess Games

Stephen Flinter and Mark T. Keane

Trinity College Dublin


Abstract. As a research topic computer game playing has contributed
problems to AI that manifest exponential growth in the problem space.
For the most part, in games such as chess and checkers these problems
have been surmounted with enormous computing power on brute-force
search methods using massive databases. It remains to be seen whether
such techniques will extend to other games such as go and shogi. One
suggestion is that these games and even chess might benefit from a
knowledge-based treatment but such approaches have met with limited
success. The problem, as ever from such approaches, is the characterisation 
of the knowledge to be used by the system. This paper deals with
the TAL system, which employs case-based reasoning techniques for chess
playing. In the paper, rather than focus on playing, we concentrate on
the automatic generation of suitable case knowledge using a chunking
technique on a corpus of grandmaster games.

Abstract   
Monitoring of the electrocardiogram during normal activity using Holter devices
has become standard procedure for detection of cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic
episodes and silent myocardial ischemia. Existing devices mostly record ""twenty-four""
hour activity and then perform off-line record analysis.    
We present realization of an intelligent DSP-based Holter device for continuous
electrocardiogram monitoring. Battery operated Holter device is realized using Texas
Instruments TMS320C542 DSP board with Del Mar PWA Amplifier Digicorder. The
proposed device could be used either for acquisition of anomalous ECG sequences
(arrhythmic events, ST segment deviation, etc.) and storing to flash memory, or as a
warning device during normal activity or exercise stress test.
Implemented environment could be used as high-performance input/output
processor. It could provide 3D virtual reality stereo output and new inputs such as user's
emotional state, which could be used as significant feedback for computer applications.

Abstract. The similar problem-similar solution hypothesis underlying 
case-based reasoning is modelled in the framework of possibility theory 
and fuzzy sets. Thus, case-based prediction can be realized in the
form of fuzzy set-based approximate reasoning. The inference process
makes use of fuzzy rules. It is controlled by means of modifier functions
acting on such rules and related similarity measures. Our approach also
allows for the incorporation of domain-specific (expert) knowledge concerning 
the typicality (or exceptionality) of the cases at hand. It thus
favors a view of case-based reasoning according to which the user interacts 
closely with the system in order to control the generalization beyond
observed data. Our method is compared to instance-based learning and
kernel-based density estimation. Loosely speaking, it adopts basic principles 
of these approaches and supplements them with the capability of
combining knowledge and data in a flexible way.

"Production Tools for Electronic Arenas: Event Management and Content Production

ABSTRACT                               

This document comprises a combined deliverable made up of Deliverables D4.3 and D4.4 to the eRENA project.
This document considers how the production of events in electronic arenas, might be supported. The concern is with
the behind-the-scenes activities which are necessary in staging an event and how those activities might be best
supported technically. Basing our research on the practical experience accumulating in eRENA, and on the field
studies of production work performed, we present novel technologies and orientations to the support of production
process, these principally focus on technologies for supporting events as they occur in real-time and include:
proposals and demonstrations of virtual cameras for capturing activity in electronic arenas, techniques for sonifying
the activity of participants in an electronic arena to give an audible sense of the status of events, a physical
environment containing tangible interfaces to production software to facilitate timely direction and production work,
and a system for mapping data from participants to enable its flexible interpretation in media-rich environments. It
also begins to consider how content for events might be developed both off-line as well as improvised in real-time.
The document contains reports of public artistic events which have driven the developments here as well as
stimulated novel cross-project collaborations. Throughout there is a concern to reflect critically on the status of the
technologies and concepts explored, where possible through formal analysis, and how they might influence and learn
from other developments in the eRENA project.

Abstract 
Sonification allows existing mathematical data to be                               
used as the model for audio output, notably that the audio                                     
produced is related to or representative of that data in some way.                             
Existing work in the field has been largely focused on the                                     
aesthetic tailoring of the output audio for compositional benefit                              
rather than as a framework for audio representation and                                        
analysis.                                                                                      
It is the goal of this research to apply existing techniques for                               
pitch substitution to an analytical method that seeks to define                                
and represent patterns within existing data sets (primarily DNA                                
and RNA sequences). It is often the case that sonified audio has                               
little or no rhythmic component, and it is felt that as rhythm is                              
such an important part of the musical analysis process it should                               
be given far more serious consideration when representing                                      
mathematical data as audio.                                                                    
In order to adequately analyse the different rhythms and time                                  
signatures that can be used to parse sonified data, a piece of                                 
software has been developed called DNASon that allows for basic                                
time interval and signature definitions for application to a                                   
sonified DNA/RNA sequence.

Abstract. Stratified case-based reasoning (SCBR) is a technique in which
case abstractions are used to assist case retrieval, matching, and adaptation. 
Previous work showed that SCBR can significantly decrease the
computational expense required for retrieval, matching, and adaptation
in a route-finding domain characterized by abstraction hierarchies with
the downward refinement property. This work explores the effectiveness
of SCBR in hierarchies without the downward refinement property. In
an experimental evaluation using such hierarchies (1) ScnR significantly
decreased search cost in hierarchies without the downward refinement
property, although the speedup over ground-level A* was not as great as
in refinable hierarchies, (2) little difference was observed in SCBR search
costs between case libraries created top-down in the process of REFINEMENT 
and those created bottom-up from a valid ground solution, and

a priori likelihood that a previous solution can be usefully applied to a

1 Introduction: Why Domains
Matter in Sense Disambiguation
An important aspect of sense disambiguation is
the wider semantic space (domain, topic) in
which the ambiguous word occurs. This may be
most clearly illustrated by some cross­lingual
examples, as they would appear in (machine)
translation. Consider for instance the English
word housing. In a more general ``sense'', this
translates in German into Wohnung. In an
engineering setting however it translates into
Gehäuse. Also verbs may be translated
differently (i.e. have a different sense) according
to the semantic space in which they occur. For
instance, English warming up translates into
erhitzen in a more general sense, but into
aufwärmen in the sports domain.
Because of the apparent relevance then of
domains or topics on sense disambiguation, a
panel was organized at SENSEVAL­2 to discuss
some current and previous work in this area. The
paper presents a more extended overview based
on the relevant literature, besides giving a
summary of the discussion that developed after
the panel presentations.

Abstract. We present an extension of an existing system, called SaxEx,
capable of generating expressive musical performances based on Case-Based 
Reasoning (CBR) techniques. The previous version of SaxEx did
not take into account the possibility of using affective labels to guide
the CBR task. This paper discusses the introduction of such affective
knowledge to improve the retrieval capabilities of the system. Three
affective dimensions are consideredtender-aggressive, sad-joyful, and
calm-restlessthat allow the user to declaratively instruct the system
to perform according to any combination of five qualitative values along
these three dimensions.

Abstract
The process of Case-Based Creative Design comprises: problem
specification, problem elaboration, case retrieval, case adaptation, and
verification. Problem specification and elaboration are crucial stages in the
design process. Notwithstanding most of the current systems do not address
this phase, assuming that the problem is well defined and complete, which is
not a valid assumption for most of the situations.
In this paper we propose a case-based method for problem
elaboration. Old design episodes are used for problem specification and
elaboration. Through the use of a graphical editor the user explores a set of
alternative problem specifications. This helps the user in the problem
specification task. If the problem still remains ill or incompletely defined, a
problem elaboration method is used to complete the problem specification
based on a library of cases and domain knowledge.

Abstract. The use of CBR has been very profitable for many areas of
artificial intelligence. Applying CBR to automated deduction, however,
is a very intricate problem. The premise small changes of a problem
cause small changes of its solution is definitely not satisfied by automated 
deduction. Therefore, case adaptation by means of symbolic proof
transformation techniques is very limited.
In view of the fact that automated deduction essentially is a search problem, 
we propose to utilize case adaptation for selecting and configuring
a search-guiding heuristic based on known cases. This also allows us to
elegantly integrate methods for learning search-guiding heuristics which
can significantly improve performance. The evaluation step of CBR corresponds 
to an attempt of the theorem prover at hand to solve a problem 
employing the heuristic provided by case adaptation. Experimental
studies demonstrated that this approach is viable and actually produces
promising results.

Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) involves constructing an
hypothesis H on the basis of background knowledge B and training examples 
E. An independent test set is used to evaluate the accuracy of H.
This paper concerns an alternative approach called Analogical Prediction 
(AP). AP takes B, E and then for each test example (x, y) forms an
hypothesis Hx from B, E, x. Evaluation of AP is based on estimating the
probability that Hx(x) = y for a randomly chosen (x, y). AP has been
implemented within CProgol4.4. Experiments in the paper show that on
English past tense data AP has significantly higher predictive accuracy
on this data than both previously reported results and CProgol in inductive 
mode. However, on KRK illegal AP does not outperform CProgol
in inductive mode. We conjecture that AP has advantages for domains
in which a large proportion of the examples must be treated as exceptions 
with respect to the hypothesis vocabulary. The relationship of AP
to analogy and instance-based learning is discussed. Limitations of the
given implementation of AP are discussed and improvements suggested.

Abstract. Online decision guides typically ask too many questions of
the user, as they make no attempt to focus the questions. We describe
some approaches to minimising the questions asked of a user in an
online query situation. Questions are asked in an order that reflects
their ability to narrow down the set of cases. Thus time to reach an
answer is decreased. This has the dual benefit of taking some of the
monotony out of online queries, and also of decreasing the amount of
network request-response cycles. Most importantly, question order is
decided at run time, and therefore adapts to the user. This approach is in
the spirit of lazy leaming with induction delayed to run-time, allowing
adaptation to the emerging details of the situation. We evaluate a few
different approaches to the question selection task, and compare the
best approach (one based on ideas from retrieval in CBR) to a
commercial online decision guide.

Abstract
A secret­sharing scheme enables a dealer to distribute a
secret among n parties such that only some predefined au­thorized 
sets of parties will be able to reconstruct the secret
from their shares. The (monotone) collection of authorized
sets is called an access structure, and is freely identified with
its characteristic monotone function f : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g.
A family of secret­sharing schemes is called efficient if the
total length of the n shares is polynomial in n. Most previ­ously 
known secret­sharing schemes belonged to a class of
linear schemes, whose complexity coincides with the mono­tone 
span program size of their access structure. Prior to
this work there was no evidence that nonlinear schemes can
be significantly more efficient than linear schemes, and in
particular there were no candidates for schemes efficiently
realizing access structures which do not lie in NC.
The main contribution of this work is the construction
of two efficient nonlinear schemes: (1) A scheme with per­fect 
privacy whose access structure is conjectured not to
lie in NC; (2) A scheme with statistical privacy whose ac­cess 
structure is conjectured not to lie in P=poly. Another
contribution is the study of a class of nonlinear schemes,
termed quasi­linear schemes, obtained by composing lin­ear 
schemes over different fields. We show that while these
schemes are possibly (super­polynomially) more powerful
than linear schemes, they cannot efficiently realize access
structures outside NC.

"An Inferential Approach to Information Retrieval and its Implementation using a Manual Thesaurus

Most inferential approaches to Information Retrieval (IR) have been investigated
within the probabilistic framework. Although these approaches allow one to cope
with the underlying uncertainty of inference in IR, the strict formalism of probability
theory often confines our use of knowledge to statistical knowledge alone (e.g.
connections between terms based on their co­occurrences). Human­-defined
knowledge (e.g. manual thesauri) can only be incorporated with difficulty. In this
paper, departing from a general idea proposed by van Rijsbergen, we first develop an
inferential approach within a fuzzy modal logic framework. Differing from previous
approaches, the logical component is emphasized and considered as the pillar in our
approach. In addition, the flexibility of a fuzzy modal logic framework offers the
possibility of incorporating human­defined knowledge in the inference process. After
defining the model, we describe a method to incorporate a human­defined thesaurus
into inference by taking user relevance feedback into consideration. Experiments on
the CACM corpus using a general thesaurus of English, Wordnet, indicate a
significant improvement in the system's performance.

"Adaptation Through Interpolation for Time-Critical Case-Based Reasoning

email: {nchatter, jac}@uk.ac.ucl.cs



Abstract. The paper introduces and examines the relevance of the notion of
""interpolation"" between case features, to facilitate fast adaptation of existing
cases to a current situation. When this situation is time-critical there is not enough
time for exhaustive comparison of various aspects of all the stored cases, so it
may not be possible to retrieve a high-quality match for a current problem within
a specified time-limit. Viewing imperfect adaptation as a process of interpolation
(or a set of possible processes with different qualities of interpolation) then gives
a robust and novel perspective for time-critical reasoning, as well as being
equally relevant for case-based reasoning (CBR) in general. Although
interpolation-like adaptation techniques have been used in some existing CBR
systems, they have not previously been treated explicitly from this perspective.

Abstract. The aim of the present paper is to investigate a retrieval strategy
for case-based diagnosis called Pivoting Based Retrieval (PBR), based on a
tight integration between retrieval and adaptation estimation. It exploits a
heuristic estimate of the adaptability of a solution; during retrieval, lower and
upper bounds for such an estimate are computed for relevant cases and a pivot
case is selected, determining which cases have to be considered and which
have not. Such a technique has been evaluated on three different domain
modeis and very satisfactory results have been obtained both in terms of
accuracy, space and retrieval time

Abstract. Current software documentation is difficult to
write and seldom meets the varying needs of its users. We
propose that by considering different users and applying
information retrieval techniques to the information included
in software documentation, we can provide effective access
to that information. We submit a set of features for inclu­sion 
in documentation database systems and describe a pro­totype 
designed to determine the usefulness of these
features.

ABSTRACT                                                                                  
In the Internet world, the widespread use of graphical     
user interfaces (GUIs) increasingly bars visually          
handicapped people from accessing digital                  
information. In this context our project aims at           
providing sight handicapped people with alternative        
access modalities to various types of GUIs and graphic    
intensive programs, in order for instance to facilitate   
usage of Web services. We describe in this paper AB-Web [1], 
a 3D-audio Web browser that allows blind         
computer users to explore Web pages, fill in forms,       
etc., using a 3D sonic rendering. We also present         
WebSound [2], a generic tool that permits to associate    
with each HTML tag a given sonic object (earcon or        
auditory icon). Finally, we describe a series of          
associated programs composed of the family of sonic       
games From Dots to Shapes [3], as well as of IDEA ,       
a tool that lets users comprehend simple drawings, as     
well as to create graphics.

"An Engineering Approach for Troubleshooting Case Bases

Abstract
Troubleshooting is a common application of case base technology. Often in these cases, the
goal is to capture the approaches of troubleshooting experts and put these troubleshooting best
practices in the hands of lesser experienced analysts. Effective knowledge capture is the
primary bottleneck to creating a good troubleshooting case base. We used the KADS
knowledge modeling methodology to guide the knowledge acquisition to create such a case
base. KADS helped us to validate the logic of the entire case base before writing one case and
to implement it more quickly than normal and with no errors. This paper illustrates our
experience in the use of KADS to help build case bases effectively.

Abstract                                            
A general framework for producing formative audio feedback for gesture recognition is          
presented, including the dynamic and semantic aspects of gestures. The beliefs states are
probability density functions conditioned on the trajectories of the observed variables. We        
describe example implementations of gesture recognition based on Hidden Markov Models              
and a dynamic programming recognition algorithm. Granular synthesis is used to present the         
audio display of the changing probabilities and observed states.

"Shaping a CBR View with XML

Abstract. Case Based Reasoning has found increasing application on the
Internet as an assistant in Internet commerce stores and as a reasoning agent for
online technical support. The strength of CBR in this area stems from its reuse
of the knowledge base associated with a particular application, thus providing
an ideal way to make personalised configuration or technical information
available to the Internet user. Since case data may be one aspect of a companys
entire corporate knowledge system, it is important to integrate case data easily
within a companys IT infrastructure, using industry specific vocabulary. We
suggest XML as the likely candidate to provide such integration. Some
applications have already begun to use XML as a case representation language.
We review these and present the idea of a standard case view in XML that can
work with the vocabularies or namespaces being developed by specific
industries. Earlier research has produced version 1.0 of a Case Based Mark-up
Language which attempts to mark-up cases in XML to enable distributed
computing. The drawbacks of this implementation are outlined in this paper as
well as the developments in XML that allow us to produce an XML View of
a companys knowledge system. We will detail the benefits of our system for
industry in general in terms of extensibility, ease of reuse and interoperability.

ABSTRACT
Most of the current tools for working with sound work on sin­gle 
soundfiles, use 2D graphics and offer limited interaction to the
user. In this paper we describe a set of tools for working with col­lections 
of sounds that are based on interactive 3D graphics. These
tools form two families: sound analysis visualization displays and
model­based controllers for sound synthesis algorithms.
We describe the general techniques we have used to develop
these tools and give specific case studies from each family. Several
collections of sounds were used for development and evaluation.
These are: a set of musical instrument tones, a set of sound effects,
a set of FM radio audio clips belonging to several music genres,
and a set of mp3 rock song snippets.

Abstract
As more online databases are integrated into digital libraries, the issue of quality control
of the data becomes increasingly important, especially as it relates to the effective retrieval of
information. Authority work, the need to discover and reconcile variant forms of strings in
bibliographic entries will become more critical in the future. Spelling variants, misspellings, and
transliteration differences will all increase the difficulty of retrieving information. We investigate
a number of approximate string matching techniques that have traditionally been used to help
with this problem. We then introduce the notion of approximate word matching and show how
it can be used to improve detection and categorization of variant forms. We demonstrate the
utility of these approaches using data from the Astrophysics Data System and show how we can
reduce the human effort involved in the creation of authority files.

Abstract
We present Scatter/Gather, a cluster­based document brows­ing 
method, as an alternative to ranked titles for the orga­nization 
and viewing of retrieval results. We systematically
evaluate Scatter/Gather in this context and find significant
improvements over similarity search ranking alone. This
result provides evidence validating the cluster hypothesis
which states that relevant documents tend to be more sim­ilar 
to each other than to non­relevant documents. We de­scribe a
system employing Scatter/Gather and demonstrate
that users are able to use this system close to its full poten­tial.

Abstract. This paper illustrates how the Case Based Reasoning (CBR)
paradigm has been applied to the definition of the requirements and the
specifications of a Knowledge Management technology supporting the
handling of tuning and anomalies in production processes. In particular,
the production of truck tyres will be illustrated as the application domain
of the proposed approach. This domain is a paradigmatic example where
the valorization of the experiential knowledge is a company requirement,
so the representation of knowledge concerning production process issues
is mandatory. It requires extending CBR techniques to an emerging area
of application involving knowledge about the interplay of static objects
(i.e. products) with dynamic objects (i.e. processes). The content of production 
cases, their organization into a Case Base and a first proposal
for the Case Base retrieval of similar cases will be presented.

"Learning Structurally Indeterminate Clauses

Abstract. This paper describes a new kind of language bias, S-structural
indeterminate clauses, which takes into account the meaning of predicates that
play a key role in the complexity of learning in structural domains. Structurally
indeterminate clauses capture an important background knowledge in structural
domains such as medicine, chemistry or computational linguistics: the
specificity of the component/object relation. The REPART algorithm has been
specifically developed to learn such clauses. Its efficiency lies in a particular
change of representation so as to be able to use propositional learners. Because
of the indeterminacy of the searched clauses the propositional learning problem
to be solved is a kind of Multiple-Instance problem. Such reformulations may
be a general approach for learning non determinate clauses in ILP. This paper
presents original results discovered by REPART that exemplify how ILP
algorithms may not only scale up efficiently to large relational databases but
also discover useful and computationally hard-to-learn patterns.

ABSTRACT
Advances in digital storage technology and the wide use of digital audio compression standards like MPEG have made possible
the creation of large archives of audio material. In order to work efficiently with these large archives much more structure
than what is currently available is needed. The creation of the necessary text indices is difficult to fully automate. However,
significant amounts of user time can be saved by having the computer assist the user during the annotation process.
In this paper, we describe a prototype audio browsing tool that was used to perform user experiments in semi­automatic audio
segmentation annotation. In addition to the typical sound­editor functionality the system can automatically suggest time lines
that the user can edit and annotate. We examine the effect that this automatically suggested segmentation has on the user
decisions as well as timing information about segmentation and annotation. Finally we discuss thumbnailing and semantic
labeling of annotated audio.

"A Case-Based Reasoning Approach to Collaborative Filtering

Robin Burke

Department of Information and Computer Science

burke@ics.uci.edu


Abstract. Collaborative filtering systems make recommendations based
on the accumulation of ratings by many users. The process has a case-based 
reasoning flavor: recommendations are generated by looking at
the behavior of other users who are considered similar. However, the
features associated with a user are semantically weak compared with
those used by CBR systems. This research examines multi-dimensional
or semantic ratings in which a system gets information about the reason
behind a preference. Experiments show that metrics in which the
semantic meaning of each rating is taken into account have markedly
superior performance than simpler techniques.

Abstract. Early work on case based reasoning reported in the literature
shows the importance of case base maintenance for successful practical
systems. Different criteria to the maintenance task have been used for
more than half a century. In this paper we present different sort out
techniques for case base maintenance. All the sort out techniques proposed 
are based on the same principle: a Rough Sets competence model.
First of all, we present sort out reduction techniques based on deletion
of cases. Next, we present sort out techniques that build new reduced
competent case memories based on the original ones. The main purpose
of these methods is to maintain the competence and reduce, as much
as possible, its size. Experiments using different domains, most of them
from the UCI repository, show that the reduction techniques maintain
the competence obtained by the original case memory. The results are
analysed with those obtained using well-known reduction techniques.

Abstract. In this paper, we present an application of case-based reasoning 
to the design of synthetic plans in organic synthesis. First, we
briefly introduce the principles of organic synthesis planning, e.g. building 
a new molecular structure or target molecule. Then, we present the
knowledge representation and reasoning principles on which relies the
system for organic synthesis planning that we are developing. Two main
kinds of reasoning processes are employed in the system. Classification-based 
reasoning is used at a tactical level for the perception of chemical
characteristics and the structure modifications of the target molecule.
Case-based reasoning is used at a strategic level to build a synthetic
plan, according to the similarity between the target molecule and memorized 
synthetic plans. The representation and the handling of one-step
synthetic plans are detailed and end the paper.

Abstract. We present COOL-TOUR, a WEB-based Case Based Reasoning 
system for tourism culture support. Its main goal is to build the
community of tourists that are interested in a geographic area. Building
communities is relevant for e-commerce and CBR can support it effectively. 
Users interact with the system entering tours for accessing auxiliary 
services. The tours are stored in a case base and other users can retrieve 
and adapt them. The community is built around these stored experiences. 
The implemented version of COOLTOUR deals with Mountain
Bike tours, providing a sketch-based interaction interface. The spatial
data similarity assessment is based on spatial indexing.

"Which Hypotheses Can Be Found with Inverse Entailment?

Akihiro YAMAMOTO*.

Meme Media Laboratory

Email: yamamoto@meme.hokudai.ac.jp



Abstract. In this paper we give a completeness theorem of an inductive 
inference rule inverse entailment proposed by Muggleton. Our main
result is that a hypothesis clause H can be derived from an example E
under a background theory B with inverse entailment if H subsumes E
relative to B in Plotkins sense. The theory B can be any clausal theory,
and the example E can be any clause which is neither a tautology nor
implied by B. The derived hypothesis H is a clause which is not always
definite. In order to prove the result we give a declarative semantics for
arbitrary consistent clausal theories, and show that SB-resolution, which
was originally introduced by Plotkin, is a complete procedural semantics.
The completeness is shown as an extension of the completeness theorem
of SLD-resolution. We also show that every hypothesis H derived with
saturant generalization, proposed by Rouveirol, must subsume E w.r.t.
B in Buntines sense. Moreover we show that saturant generalization can
be obtained from inverse entailment by giving some restriction to it.

ABSTRACT
We report experimental results associated with speech­driven text
retrieval, which facilitates retrieving information in multiple do­mains 
with spoken queries. Since users speak contents related to
a target collection, we produce language models used for speech
recognition based on the target collection, so as to improve both
the recognition and retrieval accuracy. Experiments using existing
test collections combined with dictated queries showed the effec­tiveness 
of our method.

Abstract
A new approach is developed for fault diagnosis during different stages of
development and operation of large train systems, incorporating case-based
reasoning, conditional probabilities and indexing networks. Due to the size and
complexity, the explicit, complete and accurate modelling of the on-board train
systems is regarded impossible. The knowledge is implicitly available in fault-cases
with possible symptoms, test results and actions. Off-line, different diagnostic
systems are automatically maintained and (re)generated. Knowledge and experience
of manufacturers and railway companies are fed back into all systems, but only after
validation by authorised personnel. On-line, the system responses are consistent and
fast enough, despite the size and uncertainty in the fault-cases. Available case-based
reasoning tools have serious limitations in permissible size of the problem, handling
probability factors, meeting required response times and satisfying the real-time
requirements. The novelty of the proposed approach is that fault-networks, rather
than fault-trees, are built automatically as the indexing structure of the case-base for
on-line use.

Abstract. Case-based classification is a powerful classification method,
which (in its simplest form) assigns a target case to the same class as
the nearest of n previously classified cases. Many case-based classifiers
use the simple nearest-neighbour technique to identify the nearest case,
but this means comparing the target case to all of the stored cases at
classification time, resulting in high classification costs. For this reason
many techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of case-based 
classifiers by reducing the search they must perform. In this paper
we will look at editing techniques that preserve the lazy-learning quality
of case-based classification, hut improve classification performance.

We present a new package which allows R to produce sound from data. 
The packages uses Csound, an extremely powerful and freely available multi
platform program for sound creation. Sonification is a relatively new branch
of data analysis, so even the basic set of concepts is still in ux. Our toolkit
hopefully makes research into different options for sonification methods more
accessible and helps to develop data based instruments in R.

Abstract. The present paper discusses a generalization operator based
on the A-subsumption ordering between Horn clauses introduced by the
author elsewhere. It has been shown that A-subsumption is strictly stronger
than O-subsumption and a local equivalent of generalized subsumption.
With some language restrictions it is decidable and possesses some other
useful properties. Most importantly it allows defining a non-trivial upper
bound of the A-subsumption generalization hierarchy without the use of
negative examples. Consequently this allows solving a version of the ILP
task with positive-only examples.

Abstract. This paper presents a case-based simulation environment devised
to assist neurophysiologists in the design and analysis of simulation experiments 
with biologically realistic neural networks. We describe the problem
domain and our specific notion of a case, discuss the complex structure of
such cases and present a method to automatically transform the numerical
raw data derived from simulations into a symbolic behavioral description that
can be used for further inferences by the system.

ABSTRACT                                           
We have been developing a haptic back display using a 3-by-3 tactor array.  This paper             
reports two studies that investigated the use of such a display for delivering attention- and          
direction-related information to its user.  The first study measured the effectiveness of haptic       
cues in redirecting an observers visual spatial attention.  The observer was first tapped on the      
back, and then asked to detect a change between two similar visual scenes.  We found that              
reaction time decreased by an average of 41% (1630 ms) when the location of the tactor                 
coincided with the quadrant of the visual scene where a change occurred.  We also found that           
reaction time increased by an average of 19% (781 ms) when the locations of the tapping and            
visual change did not coincide.  Such a haptic attentional cueing system can be beneficial to a        
user who must attend to information in small areas within a large and complex visual display           
(e.g., an aircraft cockpit).  In the second study, sequenced pulses were employed to impart            
directional information.  We found that naïve and minimally-trained observers were able to             
discern the directions of a set of horizontal, vertical and diagonal directional lines with an overall 
accuracy of 81%.  Means of improving the overall accuracy were suggested and tested.  These            
directional lines can be applied to a haptic navigation guidance or situation awareness system.

"Reliable Communication over Partially Authenticated Networks  

Amos Beimel y Matthew Franklin z
January 14, 1998

Abstract
Reliable communication between parties in a network is a basic requirement for
executing any protocol. In this work, we consider the effect on reliable communication
when some pairs of parties have common authentication keys. The pairs sharing keys
define a natural ``authentication graph'', which may be quite different from the ``com­munication 
graph'' of the network. We characterize when reliable communication is
possible in terms of these two graphs, focusing on the very strong setting of a Byzantine
adversary with unlimited computational resources.

Abstract. This paper describes a new quantitative similarity metric for
cases comprising an episode represented by a problem/solution pair and
an interpretation in the form of a set of imperfect explanations.
Our explanation-based metric is an alternative to other approaches that
use cases explanations for selection and retrieval. We analyse this metric
and present some examples.
We describe CLASH, a Case-Based Reasoning Expert System imple-
mented in PROLOG, which applies this metric. The results provided by
CLASH are compared with another system based on a different explanation-based 
metric for case retrieval.

"Information Extraction as a Stepping Stone toward Story Understanding

Ellen Riloff
Department of Computer Science
University of Utah
Salt Lake City, UT 84112
riloff@cs.utah.edu

Historically, story understanding systems have depended on a great deal of hand­crafted knowl­edge. 
Natural language understanding systems that use conceptual knowledge structures [SA77,
Cul78, Wil78, Car79, Leh81, Kol83] typically rely on enormous amounts of manual knowledge
engineering. While much of the work on conceptual knowledge structures has been hailed as pi­oneering 
research in cognitive modeling and narrative understanding, from a practical perspective
it has also been viewed with skepticism because of the underlying knowledge engineering bottle­neck. 
The thought of building a large­scale conceptual natural language processing (NLP) system
that can understand open­ended text is daunting even to the most ardent enthusiasts. So must we
grit our collective teeth and assume that story understanding will be limited to prototype systems
in the foreseeable future? Or will conceptual natural language processing ultimately depend on a
massive, broad­scale manual knowledge engineering effort, such as CYC [LPS86]?
Perhaps the answer lies in the current trends of information extraction research. Information
extraction (IE) is a form of natural language processing in which certain types of information must
be recognized and extracted from text. Although IE systems are typically designed for a single do­main, 
there is a great deal of interest in building systems that are easily portable to new domains.
Many researchers are developing methods to acquire the necessary domain­specific knowledge
automatically. The goal is not necessarily to produce a general­purpose information extraction
system, but to create tools that would allow users to build customized information extraction sys­tems 
quickly.
If the IE researchers are ultimately successful, we could imagine being able to create, quite
literally, an IE system ``du jour'' that is tailored to our interests on any given day. Another possible
future scenario is to assemble a large suite of IE systems, each being a specialist in extracting
information pertaining to its own area of expertise. Collectively, the suite of systems could support
conceptual natural language understanding capabilities, if not for every subject then at least for a
wide variety of subjects.
On the surface, information extraction might appear to be fundamentally different from story
understanding. And there are some important differences between these tasks. But we will argue
that the challenges and difficulties underlying them are largely the same. A corollary of this view
is that automated knowledge acquisition techniques developed for information extraction are likely
to be applicable to story understanding as well. In this chapter, we will explain how research in
information extraction may be a significant stepping stone toward progress in story understanding.
We will discuss emerging trends in the information extraction community, draw parallels between
the two types of natural language understanding, and describe recent research in automated case
frame generation for information extraction.

"Combining Words and Compound Terms for Monolingual and Cross­Language Information Retrieval

Abstract:
Most existing systems of Information retrieval (IR) use
single words as index to represent the contents of documents
and queries. One of the consequences is the low recall level.
In this paper, we propose to integrate compound terms as
additional indexing units because terms are more precise
representation units than words. Terms are recognized
through the use of a terminology database and an automatic
term extraction tool, which is based on syntactic templates
and statistical analysis. In this paper, we first show that the
use of compound terms is greatly beneficial to monolingual
IR. Then compound terms are incorporated in statistical
translation models trained on a large set of parallel texts.
Our experiments on cross­language information retrieval
(CLIR) show that such a translation model leads to a much
better CLIR effectiveness when compound terms are
integrated.

Abstract
This paper describes multi­speaker display systems for immersive auditory environments, collaborative
projects, realistic acoustic modeling, and live musical performance. Two projects are described. The sound
sub­system of the Princeton Display Wall project, and the NBody musical instrument body radiation response
project. The Display Wall is an 18' x 8' rear­projection screen, illuminated by 8 high­resolution video
projectors. Each projector is driven by a 4­way symmetric­multi­processor PC. The audio sub­system of this
project involves 26 loudspeakers and server PCs to drive the speakers in real time from soundfile playback,
audio effects applied to incoming audio streams, and parametric sound synthesis. The NBody project
involves collecting and using directional impulse responses from a variety of stringed musical instruments.
Various signal processing techniques were used to investigate, factor, store, and implement the collected
impulse responses. A software workbench was created which allows virtual microphones to be placed around
a virtual instrument, and then allows signals to be processed through the resulting derived transfer functions.
Multi­speaker display devices and software programs were constructed which allow real­time application of
of the filter functions to arbitrary sound sources. This paper also discusses the relation of spherical display
systems to conventional systems in terms of spatial audio and sound­field reconstruction, with the conclusion
that most conventional techniques can be used for spherical display systems as well.

"A priori Selection of Mesh Densities for Adaptive Finite Element Analysis, using a Case-Based Reasoning Approach

Neil Hurley


Hitachi Dublin Laboratory, OReilly Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.



Abstract. This paper describes the application of case-based reasoning
(CBR) techniques to a complex domain, namely, mesh specification for
finite element analysis. The case-base provides a high-level store of information 
extracted through CPU-intensive numerical error analysis of
previously solved problems, making it available for mesh specification
before the simulation of new similar problems. Using this information,
a near-to-optimum mesh is specified as input to the simulation engine,
avoiding time-consuming computation during simulation. The paper describes 
the system, case representation, organisation and retrieval, and
compares the CBR approach with the more usual rule-based approaches
to this application domain.

Abstract
This paper is concerned with the development of a system to support Scientific
Visualisation by utilising a computers sound channel. The sound mappings presented
here are intended to support understanding and interaction with surface data. This is
done by using sound signals associated with methods of analysis of surfaces to help the
interpretation of surface shape, data, and classification. The approach to Supportive
Sonification Development is discussed. Several examples of sound mappings are
presented and the implications for data interaction are discussed.

"Linguistic Annotation for the Semantic Web

Paul Buitelaar and Thierry Declerck
DFKI GmbH, Language Technology Department

Abstract. Establishing the semantic web on a large scale implies the widespread an­
notation of web documents with ontology­based knowledge markup. For this purpose,
tools have been developed that allow for semi­automatic annotation of web documents
with ontology­based metadata. However, given that a large number of web documents
consist either fully or at least partially of free text, language technology tools will be
needed to support this authoring process by providing an automatic analysis of the
semantic structure of textual documents. In this way, free text documents will become
available as semi­structured documents, from which meaningful units can be extracted
automatically (information extraction) and organized through clustering or classifica­tion 
(text mining). Obviously, this is of importance for both knowledge markup and
ontology development, i.e. the dynamic adaptation of ontologies to evolving appli­cations 
and domains. In this paper we present the following linguistic analysis steps
that underlie both of these: morphological analysis, part­of­speech tagging, chunking,
dependency structure analysis, semantic tagging. Examples for each are given in the
context of two projects that use linguistic and semantic annotation for the purpose of
cross­lingual information retrieval and content­based multimedia access.

Abstract
	A variety of case memory organisations and case retrieval techniques have been
proposed in the literature. Each of these has different features which can affect how useful
they are for different applications. However, in applications which are likely to hold very
large numbers of cases. which are highly volatile. and the structure of which is poorly
understood, most of the current approaches are unsuitable.
	In this paper we present a novel approach to case memory organisation and case
retrieval based on metaphors taken from the human immune system. We illustrate how the
immune system is inherently case based and how it relies on its content addressable
memory, and a general pattern matcher, to help it identify new antigens (new situations)
which are similar to old antigens (past cases). We construct a case memory based on the
immune system theory and show how its pattern recognition. learning and memory
operations can support CBR.

"A Multiple-Domain Evaluation of Stratified Case-Based Reasoning

Abstract. Stratified case-based reasoning (SCBR) is a technique in which case
abstractions are used to assist case retrieval, matching, and adaptation. Previous
work has shown that SCBR can significantly decrease the computational
expense required for retrieval, matching, and adaptation under a variety of
different problem conditions. This paper extends this work to two new domains:
a problem in combinatorial optimization, sorting by prefix reversal; and
logistics planning. An empirical evaluation in the prefix-reversal problem
showed that SCBR reduced search cost, but severely degraded solution quality.
By contrast, in logistics planning, use of SCBR as an indexing mechanism led
to faster solution times and permitted more problems to be solved than either
hierarchical problem solving (by ALPINE) or ground level CBR (by SPA)
alone. The primary factor responsible for the difference in SCBRs performance
in these two domains appeared to be that the optimal-case utility was low in the
prefix-reversal task but high in logistics planning.

purposes beyond the standard data sonication role. The    
batteries are controlled in h andy ways such as warming,  
stirring and pouring that are also visually engaging. Audio   
mappings include synthetic and sampled sounds completing

Abstract. We present a novel application of inductive logic programming 
(ILP) in the area of quantitative structure-activity relationships
(QSARs). The activity we want to predict is the biodegradability of
chemical compounds in water. In particular, the target variable is the
half-life in water for aerobic aqueous biodegradation. Structural descriptions 
of chemicals in terms of atoms and bonds are derived from the
chemicals SMILES encodings. Definition of substructures are used as
background knowledge. Predicting biodegradability is essentially a regression 
problem, but we also consider a discretized version of the target
variable. We thus employ a number of relational classification and regression 
methods on the relational representation and compare these to
propositional methods applied to different propositionalisations of the
problem. Some expert comments on the induced theories are also given.

Abstract. In this paper, we indicate some possible applications of ILP
or similar techniques in the knowledge discovery field, and then discuss 
several methods for adapting and linking ILP-systems to relational
database systems. The proposed methods range from pure ILP to
based on techniques originating in ILP . We show that it is both easy
and advantageous to adapt ILP-systems in this way.

Abstract. This paper presents a method of applying a memory-based learning
(MBL) technique to automatic building of an indexing scheme for accessing
reference cases during the conceptual design phase of a new ship. The conceptual 
ship design process begins with selecting previously designed reference
ships of the same type with similar sizes and speeds. These reference ships are
used for deriving an initial design of a new ship, and then the initial design is
kept modified and repaired until the design reaches a level of satisfactory quality. 
The selection of good reference ships is essential for deriving a good initial
design, and the quality of the initial design affects the efficiency and quality of
the whole conceptual design process. The selection of reference ships has so
far been done by design experts relying on their experience and engineering
knowledge of ship design and structural mechanics. We developed an MBL
method that can build an effective indexing scheme for retrieving good reference 
cases from a case base of previous ship designs. Empirical results show
that the indexing scheme generated by MBL outperforms those by other learning 
methods such as the decision tree learning.

Abstract
Existing audio tools handle the increasing amount of computer audio data
inadequately. The typical tape­recorder paradigm for audio interfaces is
inflexible and time consuming, especially for large data sets. On the other
hand, completely automatic audio analysis and annotation is impossible
using current techniques.
Alternative solutions are semi­automatic user interfaces that let users
interact with sound in flexible ways based on content. This approach offers
significant advantages over manual browsing, annotation and retrieval. Fur­thermore, 
it can be implemented using existing techniques for audio content
analysis in restricted domains.
This paper describes MARSYAS, a framework for experimenting, evalu­ating 
and integrating such techniques. As a test for the architecture, some
recently proposed techniques have been implemented and tested. In addi­tion, 
a new method for temporal segmentation based on audio texture is
described. This method is combined with audio analysis techniques and
used for hierarchical browsing, classification and annotation of audio files.

"Merge Strategies for Multiple Case Plan Replay *

Abstract. Planning by analogical reasoning is a learning method that consists
of the storage, retrieval, and replay of planning episodes. Planning performance
improves with the accumulation and reuse of a library of planning cases. Retrieval
is driven by domain-dependent similarity metrics based on planning goals and
scenarios. In complex situations with multiple goals, retrieval may find multiple
past planning cases that are jointly similar to the new planning situation. This
paper presents the issues and implications involved in the replay of multiple
planning cases, as opposed to a single one. Multiple case plan replay involves the
adaptation and merging of the annotated derivations of the planning cases. Several
merge strategies for replay are introduced that can process with various forms of
eagerness the differences between the past and new situations and the annotated
justifications at the planning cases. In particular, we introduce an effective merging
strategy that considers plan step choices especially appropriate for the interleaving
of planning and plan execution. We illustrate and discuss the effectiveness of the
merging strategies in specific domains.

Abstract. Even though today case-based reasoning is applied in a wide
range of different areas, there are only few systems which make use of case-based 
techniques for network management. In this paper, we outline the
domain of network management and highlight consequences for the
application of problem solvers operating in this domain. After this, we
present a case-based prototype performing a task of closed-loop network
management upon a simulated computer network together with first results.

Abstract. Land development control is the process of controlling land
development to meet the needs of the society. In this paper, we attempt to
advance the use of case-based reasoning in building a case-based decision
support system for land development control. Land development control is a
complex domain. We first discuss how to deal with the data and knowledge
involved in land development control in order to represent the knowledge and
define the case in the system. We then propose to use land use function pattern,
which is built on geospatial relations and land use functions of the proposed
development site with its surrounding environment, to simplify case input,
representation and retrieval of the system. Different land use types have
different land use function patterns. Land use function pattern can be extracted
from the domain knowledge derived from town planning legislation,
regulations, and guidelines. Our work mainly aims to support the work of
planning officers in seeking similar precedent cases in preparing
recommendations to the Town Planning Board. From the preliminary results of
the experimental system, we find that cases can be more easily input and
represented and similar case(s) can be more efficiently and effectively retrieved
using land use function pattern.

Abstract. A hybrid neuro-symbolic problem solving model is presented
in which the aim is to forecast parameters of a complex and dynamic
environment in an unsupervised way. In situations in which the rules
that determine a system are unknown, the prediction of the parameter
values that determine the characteristic behaviour of the system can be a
problematic task. The proposed system employs a case-based reasoning
model that incorporates a growing cell structures network, a radial basis
function network and a set of Sugeno fuzzy models to provide an accurate
prediction. Each of these techniques is used in a different stage of the
reasoning cycle of the case-based reasoning system to retrieve, to adapt
and to review the proposed solution to the problem. This system has
been used to predict the red tides that appear in the coastal waters of
the north west of the Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained from those
experiments are presented.

Abstract This paper proposes a methodology of maintaining Case
Based Reasoning (CBR) systems by using fuzzy decision tree
induction - a machine learning technique. The methodology is mainly
based on the idea that a large case library can be transformed to a small
case library together with a group of adaptation rules which are
generated by fuzzy decision trees. Firstly, an approach to learning
feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of
different features in a given case-base. Secondly, clustering of cases
will be carried out to identify different concepts in the case-base using
the acquired feature knowledge. Thirdly, adaptation rules will be mined
for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Finally, a selection strategy
based on the concepts of e -coverage and e -reachability is used to
select representative cases. The effectiveness of the method is
demonstrated experimentally using two sets of testing data.

Abstract. We can use a metric to measure the differences between elements 
in a domain or subsets of that domain (i.e. concepts). Which
particular metric should be chosen, depends on the kind of difference
we want to measure. The well known Euclidean metric on Rn and its
generalizations are often used for this purpose, but such metrics are not
always suitable for concepts where elements have some structure different 
from real numbers. For example, in (Inductive) Logic Programming
a concept is often expressed as an Herbrand interpretation of some first-order 
language. Every element in an Herbrand interpretation is a ground
atom which has a tree structure.
We start by defining a metric d on the set of expressions (ground atoms
and ground terms), motivated by the structure and complexity of the
expressions and the symbols used therein. This metric induces the Hausdorff 
metric h on the set of all sets of ground atoms, which allows us to
measure the distance between Herbrand interpretations. We then give
some necessary and some sufficient conditions for an upper bound of h
between two given Herbrand interpretations, by considering the elements
in their symmetric difference.

"PAC Analyses of a Similarity Learning IBL Algorithm

Email: {tony|dgb}@minster.york.ac.uk



Abstract. VS-CBR [14] is a simple instance-based learning algorithm
that adjusts a weighted similarity measure as well as collecting cases.
This paper presents a PAC analysis of VS-CBR, motivated by the
PAC learning framework, which demonstrates two main ideas relevant
to the study of instance-based learners. Firstly, the hypothesis spaces of
a learner on different target concepts can be compared to predict the
difficulty of the target concepts for the learner. Secondly, it is helpful to
consider the constituent parts of an instance-based learner: to explore
separately how many examples are needed to infer a good similarity
measure and how many examples are needed for the case base. Applying
these approaches, we show that VS-CBR learns quickly if most of the
variables in the representation are irrelevant to the target concept and
more slowly if there are more relevant variables. The paper relates this
overall behaviour to the behaviour of the constituent parts of VS-CBR.

Abstract                                    
SoniFIcation is a rather new technique in human-computer interaction, making usage 
of our auditory perception channel. Different from speech interfaces, sonification   
uses non-verbal sounds as the result of its computation. One approach in sonification    
research is the introduction of sonification models, which aim to construct virtual data  
materials from high-dimensional data to be explored by the interaction with humans.      
We propose the use of hand postures as a particularly natural and efficient means of      
interaction both for this exploration task and for other parameter control tasks within   
exploration of high-dimensional data. The presented implementation applies neural       
networks for the identification of continous hand postures and uses a realtime sound    
synthesis engine. In this paper, we present our system and rst applications to the  
control of sounds. Sound examples are also given.

Abstract. A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to re­trieve 
a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being
retrieved. In a t­private, k­server PIR protocol the database is replicated among
k servers, and the user's privacy is protected from any collusion of up to t servers.
The main cost­measure of such protocols is the communication complexity of re­trieving 
a single bit of data.
This work addresses the information­theoretic setting for PIR, in which the user's
privacy should be unconditionally protected from collusions of servers. We pre­sent 
a unified general construction, whose abstract components can be instanti­ated 
to yield both old and new families of PIR protocols. A main ingredient in
the new protocols is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam
to a communication complexity problem in the so­called simultaneous messages
model.
Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and resolves some
previous anomalies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t­private k­server PIR protocols
with O(n 1=b(2k 1)=tc
) communication bits, where n is the database size. For
t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic improvement over the previous state of
the art; (2) a constant­factor improvement in the communication complexity of
1­private PIR, providing the first improvement to the 2­server case since PIR pro­tocols 
were introduced; (3) efficient PIR protocols with logarithmic query length.
The latter protocols have applications to the construction of efficient families of
locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR protocols with reduced
work by the servers.

Abstract                                                       
Virtual environment research involves a number of related problems from a variety of
domains. A joint research at the George Washington University and the Naval Research Laboratory
is bringing together issues from these domains to study the factors that contribute to an integrated
virtual environment. The research can be divided into three general categories: human factors,
motion control, and sound synchronization. Human factors issues involve development of new
paradigms for movement and navigation essential for performance of general tasks in virtual spaces.
Novel approaches to motion control are being explored to help users of virtual environments
interact and control objects in the environment. This involves both interactive control as well as
automation through evolutionary approaches. The sounds being generated as a result of these
motions are modeled with compositional techniques to parameterize and synchronize them to the
events in the environment. The research is being approached from both a fundamental point of view
typical of an academic environment as well as from an application oriented point of view of interest
to the Navy. The cooperative relationship has benefited both the George Washington University
and the Naval Research Laboratory.

Abstract
We present a framework for concept­based, cross­lingual information retrieval (CLIR) in
the medical domain, which is under development in the MUCHMORE project. Our
approach is based on using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as the primary
source of semantic data, whereby documents and queries are annotated with multiple layers
of linguistic information. Linguistic processing includes POS­tagging, morphological
analysis, phrase recognition and the identification of medical concepts and semantic
relations between them.
The paper describes experiments in mono­ and bilingual document retrieval, performed on
a parallel English­German corpus of medical abstracts. Results show on the one hand that
linguistic processing, especially lemmatisation and compound analysis, is a crucial step to
achieving good baseline performance. On the other hand we show that semantic
information, specifically the combined use of concepts and relations, significantly increases
performance in cross­lingual retrieval.

Abstract                                                        
High-quality virtual audio scene rendering is required for eremging virtual and augmented reality applications,   
perceptual user interfaces, and sonification of data. We describe algorithms for creation of virtual auditory spaces by
rendering cues that arise from anatomical scattering, enonmentalvir  scattering, and dynamical effects. We use a novel
way of personalizing the head related transfer functions R(HTFs) from a database, based onanatomical measurements.     
Details of algorithms for HRTF interpolation, room impulse response creation, HRTF selection from a database,         
and audio scene presentation are presented. Our system runs in real time on fiacen oPCf without specialized DSP  
hardware.

"Musical Genre Classification of Audio Signals

George Tzanetakis, Student Member, IEEE, and Perry Cook, Member, IEEE

Abstract---Musical genres are categorical labels created by hu­mans 
to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is char­acterized 
by the common characteristics shared by its members.
These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation,
rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hi­erarchies 
are commonly used to structure the large collections of
music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation
is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can
assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable 
addition to music information retrieval systems. In ad­dition, 
automatic musical genre classification provides a framework 
for developing and evaluating features for any type of con­tent­-based 
analysis of musical signals.
In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into
an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically,
three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic
content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and
relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by
training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real­world
audio collections. Both whole file and real­time frame­-based
classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature
sets, classification of 61% for ten musical genres is achieved. This
result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre
classification.

Abstract. In many fields dependant upon complex observation, the
structuring, depiction and treatment of knowledge can be of great
complexity. For example in Systematics, the scientific discipline that
investigates bio-diversity, the descriptions of specimens are often highly
structured (composite objects, taxonomic attributes), noisy (erroneous or
unknown data), and polymorphous (variable or imprecise data). In this
paper, we present IKBS, an Iterative Knowledge Base System for dealing
with such complex phenomena. The originality of this system is to
implement the scientific method in biology: experimenting (learning rules
from examples) and testing (identifying new individuals, improving the
initial model and descriptions). This methodology is applied in the
following ways in IKBS: 1 - Knowledge is acquired through a descriptive
model that suits the semantic demand of experts. 2 - Knowledge is processed
with an algorithm derived from C4.5 in order to take into account structured
knowledge introduced in the previous descriptive model of the domain. 3 -
Knowledge is refined through the use of an iterative process to evaluate the
robustness of the descriptive model and descriptions. The IKBS system is
presented here as a life science application facilitating the identification of
coral specimens of the family Pocilloporidæ.

ABSTRACT
A statistician (Hansen) and a media artist (Rubin) investigate the                                                            
application of statistical methods and sound-design principles to                                                             
the real-time sonifiation of Internet communications. This paper
presents results from two applications: the sonification of browsing 
activity on Lucent's Web site, and the sonification of a large
number of Internet chat sites in real-time. These experiments suggest 
new ways to experience the diverse and dynamic data streams 
generated by modern data networks. As an art-technology collaboration, 
the project outcomes range from the creation of art installations 
to the development of practical monitoring platforms. This
paper discusses the interplay between these two perspectives, and                                                             
suggests that each is motivated by a common interest in generating                                                            
meaningful experiences with dynamic data.

We determined preferred data-to-display mappings by asking experiment participants directly and then examined the
psychophysical scaling functions relating perceived data values to underlying acoustic parameters. Presently, we are
extending and validating the scaled mappings in practical data interpretation tasks. The resulting scaling functions, in
conjunction with the experimental paradigm developed here, should spark further research in this area and have implications
for the design of future sonifications.

"Attribute-Value Learning Versus Inductive Logic Programming: The Missing Links (Extended Abstract)

email : Luc.DeRaedt@cs.kuleuven.ac.be


Abstract. Two contributions are sketched. A first contribution shows
that a special case of relational learning can be transformed into attribute-value 
learning. However, it is much more tractable to stick to the relational 
representation than to apply the sketched transformation. This
provides a sound theoretical justification for inductive logic programming. 
In a second contribution, we show how existing attribute-value
learning techniques and systems can be upgraded towards inductive logic
programming using the Leuven methodology and illustrate it using the
Claudien, Tilde, ICL, Warmr, TIC, MacCent and RRL systems.

Abstract. A Bayesian method for incorporating probabilistic background
knowledge into ILP is presented. Positive only learning is extended to
allow density estimation. Estimated densities and defined prior are combined 
in Bayes theorem to perform relational classification. An initial
application of the technique is made to part-of-speech (POS) tagging. A
novel use of Gibbs sampling for POS tagging is given.

Abstract. Some problem-solving tasks are amenable to integrated case
retrieval and generative planning techniques. This is certainly true for
some decision support tasks, in which a user controls the problem-solving
process but cannot provide a complete domain theory. Unfortunately,
existing integrations are either non-interactive or require a complete domain 
theory and/or complete world state to produce acceptable plans,
preventing them from being easily used in these situations. We describe
a novel integrated algorithm, named SiN, that is interactive aud does
not require a complete domain theory or complete world state. SiN users
leverage a conversational case retriever to focus both partial world state
acquisition and plan generation. We highlight the benefits of SiN (e.g.,
quadratically fewer cases needed) in an experimental study using a new
travel planning domain.

"Inductive Logic Programming for Natural Language Processing

Raymond J. Mooney

Abstract. This paper reviews our recent work on applying inductive
logic programming to the construction of natural language processing
systems. We have developed a system, CHILL, that learns a parser from a
training corpus of parsed sentences by inducing heuristics that control an
initial overly-general shift-reduce parser. CHILL learns syntactic parsers
as well as ones that translate English database queries directly into 
executable logical form. The ATIS corpus of airline information queries was
used to test the acquisition of syntactic parsers, and CHILL performed
competitively with recent statistical methods. English queries to a small
database on U.S. geography were used to test the acquisition of a 
complete natural language interface, and the parser that CHILL acquired was
more accurate than an existing hand-coded system. The paper also 
includes a discussion of several issues this work has raised regarding the
capabilities and testing of ILP systems as well as a summary of our
current research directions.

Abstract                                                                              
A mathematical model that predicts the changes to the ultrasound frequency spectrum           
after passing through human tissue and Albunex (a registered trademark of 
Molecular Biosystems Inc., San Diego, CA) microspheres is proposed. Changes in                
backscattered intensity and mean frequency of the reflected signal can be estimated           
as a function of imaging geometry, ultrasound frequency, and microsphere                      
concentration and size distribution.                                                          
An important result is that the frequency shifts and the intensity variations are caused      
both by the microspheres in the path between the transducer and the region of interest,       
and by the reflection properties of the contrast agent in the region of interest.             
The model enables one to explain and predict clinically observed intensity effects            
such as the shadow effect in the right ventricle, and the fact that received intensity        
increases with concentration up to a certain point where it falls off.                        
The effect of the removal of the larger microspheres in the lungs is so significant that      
concentrations that give positive frequency shifts with increasing concentration in the       
right ventricle will give negative shifts in the left ventricle. The frequency shift is only  
a good indicator of concentration for ultrasound frequencies below 4 MHz, while the           
intensity is very sensitive to Albunex microsphere concentration and imaged depth    
also at the higher frequencies.                                                               
It is also found that the periodic variation in heart muscle thickness during the heart       
cycle will affect the intensity and mean frequency of the backscattered ultrasound            
observed in the left ventricle significantly, and in such a way as to give them a             
periodic variation over the heart cycle.
